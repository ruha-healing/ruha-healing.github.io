### Sunday, 6 PM Central European Time

This is a **free** class as a gift to help us through this exceptional time.

####  🎉  What

We do an **one hour beginner Kundalini set** together. You can join from **wherever** you are. All you need is an internet enabled device such as a laptop, tablet or phone to be able to see and listen to my instructions. It's going to be fun!

#### ⏱️ When

The class starts at **6 PM Central European Time** ([Find your local time](https://savvytime.com/converter/ca-san-francisco-to-ny-new-york-city-germany-berlin-singapore-singapore/apr-26-2020/3pm)) but the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) room opens **20 minutes earlier**. I recommend to show up early as participation is limited.

#### 💻 How

Just sign up with your name and email and you'll receive instructions on how to join the **Zoom meeting**. Rest assured, I will **never** use your email for anything else or share it with anybody else.
