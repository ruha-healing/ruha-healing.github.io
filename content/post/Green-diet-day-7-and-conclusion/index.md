# Day 7
</center>

For breakfast today I had the same for the last time as the previous six days. I still liked this mixture of fresh fruits very much. Nevertheless I can say that I was looking forward to the growing variety in the coming days. 

After my work in the morning I started to cook again. For the last day this steamed vegetables were on the menu: **broccoli, zucchini and leek**. This was once again a very tasty combination and I ate a big portion of it.

As expected, this lunch didn't keep me full for too long, so I prepared another **green smoothie** in the afternoon. This one was very tasty again and made of cress, half a banana, lemon, grapes, apple and rosemary. This preparation of smoothies in general is something that I would like to include more in my daily diet. They are quick to prepare, very healthy and can be customized. **Definitely a recommendation!** üëåüèΩ

For dinner I fried the last **green asparagus with onion and garlic**. I also had the rest of today's smoothie. All together the dinner was a really delicious meal. Peacefully I enjoyed everything in the evening sun and felt a lot of **happiness and well-being** inside me. With this feeling finally the seventh and for this time last day of my green diet passed.

### A few final thoughts...

Wow, I was really amazed at how quickly these 7 days went by. From the first day after the green diet I returned to eating non-green food. I was looking forward to eat other things again - **variety** is just fun and I love to cook and spontaneously throw things together. I also did this "throwing together" during the green diet and found it very exciting with green food as well. I can imagine myself doing this diet form for a few more days next time, because I still have some **other recipe ideas and ingredients** in my mind that would like to be realized. 

After a few days of the changeover I got really well used to this diet form and felt very **energetic**. I think it is a nice way to **eat consciously and healthily**. My body definitely felt **lighter and more comfortable**. I haven't experienced the usual feeling of fullness once, because the food is simply much lighter during the green diet. Everything was very **easy to digest** for me and I generally perceived my digestion as very positive. 
Moreover, I did my own yoga set every morning and also practiced **Kundalini Yoga** sets on several evenings. This yoga **supported me very well** and additionally energized me and provided me with **prana**, i.e. life energy. A **combination of the green diet and Kundalini Yoga** is therefore also something I can warmly recommend. 

The breakfast on the "day after" was more colourful again. There were green fruits, strawberries and oranges as well as oatmeal - all together as a colorful mix. Delicious! üòç

Furthermore, I can say that my "relationship" to the **color GREEN** has intensified to a certain extent. Green can be found in so many things and is omnipresent. The power of this color is really tangible, the energy of green has definitely **strengthened me**. 

Maybe you would like to experience a green diet too!? You are more than welcome to write to me if you have further questions on this topic or if you would like to exchange ideas. üôÉ

### Well, by the way: What does my dear dietary friend actually think about this whole thing? 


"When I first heard about this diet, I was very interested in trying this type of diet. Elvira asked me if I would like to join her and experience it at the same time. I read an article about it, in which they suggested to do the diet for 40 days ... ü§™ 
To be honest, I was a little worried if I could do it, but Elvira and I decided to try it for one week the first time. 

On the first day I was really **excited** to see how my body and of course my mind would accept this challenge. I must say that it was really nice to have this experience, but after four days I started to miss more "colours" in my food.

**The hardest fight for me was not using salt.** I stopped drinking coffee two days before the diet. This was helpful to get used to the new way of eating and drinking.

I think I'll do the diet again, maybe like a **little ritual four times a year**. By the way, I lost some weight, but half of it came back after I returned to my normal eating habit. But losing weight was not my main goal either." 

Thanks for sharing this experience with me, dear friend! üôèüèΩ 

I hope you can gain some **inspiration** and **courage** from our experiences to try out such a diet and just have a new experience for you & with you. Have fun with it! ‚ú®
