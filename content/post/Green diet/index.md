## Green Diet - What is that?

There really is an endless amount and range of diets and it feels like there is always a new one popping up somewhere. With this green diet from Kundalini Yoga I have discovered a completely new diet for me, which I find very appealing. This diet uses the effect of the green substance chlorophyll, which can be found in any green food. So during the green diet you eat mainly green fruits and vegetables and drink a lot of water or tea. This type of diet is vegan and is not limited in the amount of food you eat. 

### Effects

The green diet is alkaline and thus balances your acid-base balance with a focus on the alkaline. In doing so, you deacidify your body and start a detoxification process in your liver, which eventually rebuilds your whole system. In addition, your skin is cleaned and toxic mucus is removed from your liver. Weight loss can also be a side effect, but this is not the main focus. This and even more happens mainly due to the ingredient 

### CHLOROPHYLL. 

Green food contains chlorophyll to varying degrees. This can have a health-promoting effect on your body due to the amount absorbed. This strengthens your immune system and your defences. Chlorophyll is also an antioxidant and protects your body from free radicals. Your magnesium and iron balance is improved and your blood cells are purified and new blood cells are formed. Chlorophyll is also known as a natural anti-aging agent.

All in all, your whole body experiences an activation on a physical and mental level and can only benefit from it. 

### What to eat?

The possibilities here are definitely sufficient and it is also an interesting focus to concentrate only on green food. It is a pleasure to walk through the supermarket with this attention and be surprised by the green variety. :) 
I'll list some food groups with examples here, which should be readily available as a rule:

- any green salads and leafy vegetables (e.g. rocket, lamb's lettuce, chicory, spinach, chard, pakchoi)
- sprouts and germs (e.g. mung beans, green lentils)
- green vegetables (e.g. asparagus, okras, zucchini, broccoli, peas, green beans, spring onions, green peppers, leek, fennel and many more)
- green fruits (e.g. limes, from the inside green melons, pears, apples, kiwis, grapes, cucumber, olives, avocado)
- Oils (e.g. olive oil, pumpkin seed oil, ghee)
- Herbs (e.g. nettle, wild garlic, dandelion, peppermint, lemon balm, parsley, coriander and many more)
- spices (e.g. green pepper, wasabi, dried green spices)
â†’ Important: No salt!
- Superfoods like wheatgrass, nettle powder, spirulina, chlorella and hemp protein

### And what about drinking?

Water and herbal teas (also green tea) are the most important things. But also green juices and the many well-known green smoothies are allowed and a satisfying snack between meals. These are best prepared fresh. In fact, you can also drink the cooked or steamed water from your vegetables. Nothing has to be poured away. ;) However, there are also drinks that you should not consume: coffee, alcohol and black tea. It makes sense to wean yourself off these drinks before you start your green diet, if you drink them at all. 

Well, so much for the theory of this detoxifying, purifying diet form. I have decided to go on the green diet for 7 days. Together with a friend of mine I plan to eat only green for the next (at least) 7 days. Exciting!
