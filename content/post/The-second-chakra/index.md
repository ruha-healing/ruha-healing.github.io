After I introduced you to the power of the chakras and the first chakra in particular in my last blog post, I will now focus on the next chakra in this series: the **sacral chakra**, also known as the **sexual chakra**. 
In Sanskrit this chakra is called **Svadisthana**, where sva stands for "self" or "prana" and adisthana for "home" or "dwelling place". Thus, in summary, the translation **"dwelling place of the self"** can be crystallized. 

The sacral chakra is located in the **region of the sexual organs**, at the level of the hip bones under the navel. Relevant here are the **reproductive glands** (testicles, ovaries) as well as the kidneys and bladder. 
**Orange** is assigned to this second chakra as the color. Together with the first and third chakra it belongs to the **lower triangle**.  
The main themes of this chakra are **creativity, sexuality and reproduction, desire, sensuality as well as vitality and joy of life**. Basically, sensual, sexual and emotional experiences are processed in this chakra.

More precisely this means that the sacral chakra is about the **sensual experience of life and touching the world**. The soul shows itself here with its desire for joyful interaction with life, for participation in the creative play of life energy. In the experimential space of this chakra, all pure forms in the areas of life force, joy of life and emotional self-expression can be experienced. The **deep need for the flow of life energy and living out of our creative power**, which is inherent in all of us, lies in the sacral chakra. It is therefore a matter of experiencing creative life energy. **Creativity** can be created, for example, through words and vibrations that you produce. 
This is possible, among other things, through **sexuality**, because through this we can express life energy as well as needs and experience and directly touch the world. Equally important is the experience of **emotions**, because these allow an intense and colourful exploration of the world and make your experience as a human being in this world real for the soul. 

The **sexual contact with another person is a first experience of merging and going beyond your own self**, as it comes to dissolving with and into each other. During the sexual release a state of forgetting yourself arises for a short moment, which allows you to **experience bliss** by letting go and merging. **Finity and infinity connect** in this moment of physical love and create a feeling of **creative consciousness**. Sexuality can thus finally be used to experience the spirit. The act itself is an opportunity to live out **creativity**. 

The power of emotions is also an important aspect. In fact, **our feelings are connected to our thoughts**, so thinking is not a non-emotional activity. The thoughts that you have evoke different emotions and the feelings in turn control the intensity, current and credibility of your thoughts. 

### The element water 

The sacral chakra is associated with the element water and the organs that regulate the water balance in the body. It is about the **flow of life energy, vitality and general health** through an active second chakra. 
Just as water moves freely, flows and has no predetermined form, so it is with feelings. These can give form to our **habits**. Water has the corresponding ability to shape the earth through constant influence, and it is much more flexible than the element earth (belonging to the root chakra).

If the second chakra **works well**, you live in **passion, motivation and with independent opinions**. The language is often characterized by sensuality, colorfulness and target orientation as well as being flexible and fluent. This is reminiscent of the above mentioned properties of water. 💦

People with a distinct, open second chakra **see the world in terms of feelings and desires, as a place to fulfill passions**. There is a passionate relationship to the liveliness itself, so that these people like to feel their liveliness. They devote themselves fully to the experience of life, live in the moment, feel joy and passion, accept their own emotions with confidence and live them out. They also like to let their sexual energy flow with devotion, enjoy it and have a sexual life marked by lust. 
Furthermore, they **rarely feel guilt or shame** and live **in harmony with their true physical and emotional needs**, which they pursue with a healthy matter of course. **Self-acceptance** and **self-love** are often well developed on this basis and **inner balance** is present. 🧡

### That is tasty! 

The **sense** associated with this chakra is **taste**. It is interesting to note that the taste in your mouth **changes** when you **experience great passion**. When you practice yoga, for example, you enter into a connection with the infinite, which can trigger the production of the sweet nectar Amrit and finally a change in taste. 

### Out of balance...

However, the sacral chakra - just like any other chakra - can be blocked or disrupted and thus cause manifestations that can make living and acting difficult. This can happen, for example, when a person simply **lacks sensual, sexual and emotional experiences** or when **overwhelming and therefore too intense experiences** have been made in this area. Both extremes - undersupply as well as oversupply - lead to an imbalance or blockage.
The consequences are visible through many characteristics, for example in **frozen emotions, feelings of guilt, boundless action and a lack of responsibility in relationships**. In addition, a **reduced flow of life energy** is often reported and an associated reduced joy of life, including **chronic fatigue and listlessness**. Due to a low level of passion, the own opinion is not very pronounced. Signs of a dysfunctional sacral chakra can also be seen in the acting out of sexuality. On the one hand there can be an **increased loss of libido**, i.e. a reduced desire for sexual interactions, and on the other hand there can be an **excessive desire for sex**, which is more likely to be described as sexual addiction or sexual mania. 

In general, **problems in dealing with the own emotions as well as those of the fellow human beings** occur here.
On a physical level, there can be problems with the **kidneys and reproductive organs**. Potency problems, urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases can also arise.

### Kundalini Yoga & Svadisthana

As already mentioned in the first article about the chakras, the practice of Kundalini Yoga can help you to activate energies within your body and therefore also your chakras, to open and balance them. 🧘🏽‍♂️
It is important to remind yourself that the exercises can **create a balance and establish a relationship with the energies of the other chakras**. With this a full functionality of the chakras can be (re)gained. 

Here is a list of **exercises** from Kundalini Yoga that can help you to work on your sacral chakra:

- Frogs
- Cobra
- Butterfly
- Sat Kriya
- Cat - Cow
- Maha Mudra
- Pelvic lifting

In general I would like to point out again that this list is not a "universal remedy" and **you have to look for yourself what works and what doesn't, where the individual possibilities and limits are!** It can serve as a help, which you are welcome to try out if you feel like working on your second chakra.

Within a Kundalini Yoga session usually different chakras are touched and activated, often with a special focus. If you would like to know more about this or if you would like to book a Kundalini Yoga session with me on a specific chakra or topic, feel free to **send me an email**. ✉️
