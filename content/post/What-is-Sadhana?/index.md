**Sadhana**. You may have heard about this specific term, which is especially used in the world of **Kundalini Yoga**. But what’s that all about?

In this article you will find a basic presentation of Sadhana as a core theme from Kundalini Yoga. You will learn what is done in Sadhana, what effects this can have, and how you can practice your own Sadhana.

### What is Sadhana?

Sadhana means **daily spiritual practice**. The aspect of “daily” is not to be neglected at all, since you will create an important **foundation** through a very regular practice of **spirituality**.

This requires a certain amount of **self-discipline**, which in turn, gives you the opportunity to **express infinity in your own self**.

In Kundalini Yoga, the practice of Sadhana has an important meaning, which is why it’s recommended to all yogis and yoginis.

Through Sadhana, you open yourself up to the possibility to perceive and finally overcome any patterns that lead you away from your **higher consciousness**. It is a **consciously performed practice** that is meant to serve you.

### Here are the 6 steps of a traditional Kundalini Sadhana:

Classically, in the **two and a half hours** before sunrise, you practice the following things in this specific order.

1. **Recitation**
The Japji Sahib is a prayer from Sikhism, which is recited and chanted in a meditative way at the start of the day. 

2. **Chanting**
The “Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo” mantra is used to begin all Kundalini practices.

3. **Kriya**
Next, you practice a Kriya of Kundalini Yoga to keep your physical body fit, strengthen circulation, release tension, and stimulate the Kundalini energy within you. A Kriya consists of movements, breathwork, chanting, and meditation.
