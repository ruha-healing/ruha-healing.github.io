Sat Nam, dear soul!

There are **news** at Ruha Healing and I am totally happy to share them with you. 🤗 

Imagine, **I have opened a [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjR4h8QUBW_gUnXkfbEdKQA)!** 
Wow, I would never have thought that myself. If someone had asked me a year ago if I would create Youtube videos, I would have probably said no. And today? The reality looks completely different than I thought - as so often. 😉 That's exactly what makes it fun and exciting to live, that **we never know what the future will bring and that we should always stay open and flexible for everything that comes**. 
Now it's actually happened that I am **active on Youtube**. I do this mainly to serve you in the yogic sense. The channel should be a **help for you to practice Kundalini Yoga regularly** and to connect with yourself through it. 

### How does that look like exactly?

From now on there will be **regular uploads in my Youtube channel**. Once a month I would like to share a video from my **Kundalini Yoga Live Sessions** with you. This gives you the opportunity to get a taste of the world of Kundalini Yoga and to gain practical experience. Of course you can also get to know me and my way of teaching. 
I would be very happy if you **use this opportunity** and practice Kundalini Yoga with me. 

### Curious?

Then **have a look** directly!

Because it's just too precious to keep it for me, I share one of my Kundalini Yoga videos with you right now. Look at it with pleasure, spread out your mat and **dive into the world of Kundalini Yoga**. I teach a **Kriya for the nervous system** and end the class with the **meditation for a calm heart**. *Wahe Guru!*

### A look into the future

Furthermore, I plan to upload smaller videos for you on Youtube **regularly**. In these videos I would like to introduce you to many **different aspects of Kundalini Yoga such as breathing techniques**. Your yoga practice can get a deep foundation, because in these videos I go even deeper into the material. This will be very **enriching for your very individual practice**. I am already looking forward to creating and sharing my videos with y'all. 

### But that's not all ...

... because you can **sign up for my ongoing Kundalini Yoga Online Sessions at any time**. It takes place **every Sunday** and the **first Wednesday of every month**. There we practice Kundalini Yoga online in a familiar circle on various topics of life. You are welcome to register for a **free trial session** with me without any pressure. 

I am very happy to get to know you! 🥰
