**Kundalini Yoga was brought to the West by Yogi Bhajan in 1968.** In fact, this practice was previously only available to selected yogis, and therefore, rather secret.

But Yogi Bhajan’s goal was to train more teachers instead of gathering a bunch of students around him.

Since first being introduced to the West, the practice of Kundalini Yoga has become more and more popular and many people have deeply benefited from this unique yoga practice.

### What Is the Origin of Kundalini Yoga?

Kundalini Yoga has been practiced for thousands of years. It’s a tradition with a long lineage passed down through many teachers.

It speaks of a **“golden chain”** as a link to all previous and current teachers. This gives Kundalini Yoga a **deeply spiritual aspect**.

It is believed that practicing Kundalini Yoga can lead you to your **awakened inner identity**.

### What Does “Kundalini” Mean?

The word *Kundalini* comes from Sanskrit and is translated as “rolled up; sleeping snake power.” **Every** human being carries this power, the Kundalini energy or consciousness energy, within him or herself. It is a **creative force**.

The Kundalini is also called the **nerve of the soul**, which can be awakened. With the awakening of this energy, the yogi attains a **higher level of consciousness**. Therefore, Kundalini Yoga is also often called the **“yoga of consciousness”**.

Kundalini Yoga represents the **highest technique** that can awaken your consciousness and your soul. Through this process of awareness, you can unfold your very **own truth** that naturally lives within you.

The practice is considered a **safe** way to activate this creative force within you – without losing your hold on the earth.
