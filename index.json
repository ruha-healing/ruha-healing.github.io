The participants are then invited to chant the mantras (alternatively humming, speaking or thinking - but ideally chanting) and thus awaken a very special power: the Naad.\nWhat does Naad mean? The Naad is the inherent being of every sound, or the sound current. Through the harmony in the vibration you can experience infinity and feel it within you. Every sound influences you and changes your state. By speaking or chanting positively affirmed mantras, you allow your soul to access the higher energies and an elevated state of consciousness.\nWhat does mantra mean? Basically, the word mantra comes from Sanskrit and is translated as sacred syllable/word/verse. In yoga, a mantra is spoken of as the creative projection of the mind. Through the generated sound or sound current and the vibration, a mantra triggers a specific, targeted effect on you and your chakras. Each mantra brings its own sound and thus specific energy, which can then affect you. You can therefore also use mantras in a very specific way to create a certain effect. This in turn allows you to control and direct your mind more consciously. Each mantra has a positive effect on you and supports you in your individual processes.\nThe language of mantras The mantras used in Kundalini Yoga are primarily from Gurmukhi, a sacred Indian language, and thus are usually not directly translatable for us. A few Kundalini Yoga mantras are also in English. You can find out for all mantras their translation as well as meaning or inherent power in books or online. However, for the effect of the mantras you do not need to understand its words and their meaning, because the mantra works anyway. Often you will have a sense of it and can trust it when you feel drawn to a particular mantra - perhaps initially for no apparent reason.\nMy advice: Trust your intuition and let it guide you \u0026hellip;\nSpeciality in Kundalini Yoga Especially in Kundalini Yoga mantras attain a special position and have a much higher priority compared to other yoga styles. The power of mantras is an important part of Kundalini Yoga and therefore indispensable. Right at the beginning of a Kundalini Yoga session, two well-known mantras are chanted - first the Adi Mantra, which is usually followed by the Mangala Charan Protective Mantra.\nAdi Mantra \u0026amp; Translation ONG NAMO GURU DEV NAMO (I salute the energy that leads me from darkness to light).\nMangala Charan Mantra AD GURE NAMEH (I salute the energy that is always there.)\nJUGAD GURE NAMEH (I salute the energy through all the ages.)\nSAT GURE NAMEH (I salute the true energy.)\nSIRI GURU DEV-E NAMEH (I salute the all-encompassing energy.)\nTo conclude the yoga class, the song May the long time sun is classically sung with 3 final long \u0026ldquo;Sat Nam\u0026rdquo;.\nMay the long time sun MAY THE LONG TIME SUN\nSHINE UPON YOU\nALL LOVE SURROUND YOU\nAND THE PURE LIGHT WITHIN YOU\nGUIDE YOUR WAY ON\nThus, each yoga session has a clear framework and also triggers trust through this recurring ritual of mantra singing. In addition, within the yoga session, (short) mantras are regularly used - such as Har (which means creative creativity). These are often related to a movement. Especially the mantra Sat Nam is offered again and again for the students to let it resonate as a mantra in their mind during the individual exercises. Often the mantra is then combined with the breath, i.e. inhale Sat, exhale Nam. This tightens the focus of the student. Sat Nam can be translated as true identity.\nMeditation \u0026amp; Mantra In addition, there are many meditations that use a mantra. So-called Celestial Communications use a certain mantra recurrently and connect the words with certain body movements. Here the use of creativity is definitely allowed, so that different movements can be used in harmony with the mantra. This form of meditation in movement is something very special and unique, which you will find in this form in the yoga world only in Kundalini Yoga.\nWould you like to get in touch with mantras and practice some Kundalini Yoga? Then feel welcome to join my yoga classes at any time. As a small gift from me, the first yoga session is free of charge, so you can join without any pressure. Feel free to sign up for it and dive into this fascinating Kundalini Yoga world of mantras and more.\nHave fun exploring the world of mantras \u0026amp; more. 🎶\n","date":1624320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624320000,"objectID":"6d0ce82a0982406f65b0a656b17f74f9","permalink":"https://ruhahealing.com/post/mantras-in-kundalini-yoga/","publishdate":"2021-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mantras-in-kundalini-yoga/","section":"post","summary":"Surely you have already encountered a mantra and perhaps you could already feel the special power of it within you.

But why? Women have eleven moon points and are strongly influenced by them, while men have only one moon point. Nevertheless, the article is also exciting for men, in order to be able to classify and understand the women in their life and environment a little better. Haven\u0026rsquo;t men always wanted to understand women? 😉\nMoon points - what is that? Moon points are areas of the body that react to the moon energy. These lunar energies affect your emotional balance, that is, your mood. The moon influences our earth, the tides, but also the growth of plants and even hair, as well as the rhythms of animals and the cycle of women. So the moon\u0026rsquo;s sphere of influence is quite massive, and we can - indeed, should - take advantage of our knowledge of it. After all, it can help us to understand some connections in a new way and find a new approach especially in our interaction with other people, ourselves and especially women.\nMoon point of the man As already mentioned, only one moon point is found in men. This is located on the chin. If a man wears a beard on this spot, solar energy can be absorbed through it and consequently the influence of the moon can be neutralized. Also, it is in the nature of the man to gain the greater influence through the energy of the sun. Accordingly, the influence of the moon in men is much less than in women.\nMoon points of the woman Women, on the other hand, have eleven moon points that influence their emotional experience. Each moon point controls different aspects of personality. Moon energy also flows into women through the chin and is then transmitted to the moon points. About every 2.5 days a woman\u0026rsquo;s moon point changes, which means that every 2.5 days a different moon point is supplied with moon energy and is therefore present. Thus, a cycle through all eleven moon points lasts about 28 days.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at all eleven moon points and their respective effects on the woman one after the other.\n1 Hairline These days are characterized by the qualities of centeredness, self-confidence, open-mindedness, clarity, strength as well as decisiveness. You are completely and most of all yourself, which means you know who you are and what you want. You are at your best at this time. You succeed in neutral communication and feel light. This is a good time to make important decisions in your life.\n2 Eyebrows This moon point brings you flourishing ideas, fantasies, imagination and expansion of consciousness. It is a good time to express your creativity and sow new ideas, however, it is not the best time to make decisions as there is a danger of getting in your own way.\n3 Cheeks The cheeks harbor powerful energies and a very irritable mood. You are very emotional and out of control. You are bothered by the smallest things. There is a danger that you will look for strife and resistance. You can balance this tendency through meditation as well as conscious communication. In this phase, discipline is necessary to keep yourself in check. Eating well and drinking a lot is also helpful. Use these days rather for retreat and for some time with yourself and best do not make any important decisions.\n4 Lips Wow, all of a sudden you are totally talkative. Your communication goes to extremes - it\u0026rsquo;s either effective, uplifting and positive, or sharp-tongued, destructive and annoying. Find your balance and do things that are good for you, such as meditation. Rely on your intuition and feel whether the tendency in you is more negative or positive, and depending on the situation, it is better to stay calm.\n5 Earlobes When your earlobes rule the energies, it means constant questioning and discussion of values for you. You are very analytical with a tendency to be highly self-critical. This is not a good time to make final decisions.\n6 Neck The neck represents a desire for sensuality and romance and brings to life your need for touch through skin contact, music, romantic books and movies. You are loving, gentle, kind, and also a risk taker. You have an enchanted daily life through little things that make you happy. Self-love is especially easy for you now. It is important to you to take time for yourself. You also like to flirt and have a desire for new things. These days are also not a good time to make important decisions.\n7 Breasts Now you feel a great deal of compassion and like to give to your fellow man. You have a strong social commitment and a feeling of +*overflowing love**. These days you are very anchored in your heart. Your longing for intimacy is being pursued and you feel connected to the big whole. However, saying no is difficult for you, so this is also not a good time for personal as well as business decisions.\n8 Belly Button On these days you feel a strong insecurity and instability. You succeed only little, your concentration is weaker. You lack the desire to socialize, so you tend to withdraw. Right now you are very vulnerable - especially to criticism. You have a tendency to compensate for your insecurity by being aggressive. Therefore, accept the help of others instead of playing the strong woman when you actually feel weak. Listen to your inner self and relax when you need it. Exercises to strengthen your navel will help you and chanting is also good. Currently is not a good time for discussions.\n9 Thighs Your presence is characterized by steadfastness and you are in the process of wanting to affirm and confirm everything. Others sense your great persistence and that you strongly hold and assert your own opinions. You are full of energy, productive, self-reliant and able to get things done with ease. Finally, a good time to make decisions has arrived.\n10 Clitoris This moon point awakens your need for wider social circles as well as expanding contacts. You are talkative and charming, meeting friends and generally enjoying going out. Social interaction delights and fulfills you. This is a good time to take leadership and organize things. But be careful not to ostracize the other people around you too much.\n11 Vagina Your vagina represents your need for closeness in the narrower sense (partner, family and friends). Deep intimacy and companionship are important to you. However, you may also have a feeling of emptiness and a need to be alone. If so, take some time off and enjoy meditating. Connect with the divine and your stillness!\nAnd how do you deal with this knowledge now? 🌙 If you know the sequence of your moon points, you can understand yourself much better and also your partner, family and friends can benefit from this knowledge. The good thing is, if you first know the sequence of your moon points, because this sequence always stays the same - unless you experience an enormous shock or trauma. To figure out the sequence, you can, for example, write down in your calendar every day how you feel and which moon point that might correspond to. Just rely on your feeling and trust your intuition. Through conscious observation, you will be able to figure out your moon point progression well.\nYou can also use Kundalini Yoga techniques to stimulate your moon points. In general, chanting mantras is an excellent technique for this. You can also practice the Kirtan Kriya while lying down to balance your moon points. To do this, lie on your belly and rest your chin on the floor. Your arms are on the sides of your body with your palms facing up. With your fingers, form the sequence familiar from Kirtan Kriya along with the \u0026ldquo;Sa Ta Na Ma\u0026rdquo; mantra. You can do this meditation for 3 - 31 minutes. Feel free to do it for 40 days at a time to get a long term effect.\nI wish you much joy in exploring your moon points!

Surely you’ve heard the term aura before and know roughly what it’s all about.\nToday, let’s dive a little deeper into the knowledge of auras from the perspective of Kundalini Yoga.\nWhat Is Your Aura? And How Does It Act as Your Eighth Chakra? Many chakra theories and illustrations do not include the aura as the Eighth Chakra. In Kundalini Yoga, however, the aura plays as significant a role as any of the other seven major chakras.\nThe aura is located outside your body. It is related to your radiance. In terms of color, the aura is represented as white and is located in the electromagnetic field of your body. In the Eighth Chakra, the effects of all other chakras are brought together.\nIt’s not associated with any of the elements, but simply with the feeling of being. The aura gives you the space for yourself and fills it with yourself. Essentially, your aura is your presence.\nIn the Eighth Chakra, the effects of all other chakras are brought together. The aura also represents the power of the energy shell that surrounds all the other seven chakras, a kind of ambient field.\nWithin the specific energy of the aura, the universal flow of energy is fixed. You can feel a deep connection within you through the power of your aura as it weaves you into the entire universe.\nEvery person has an aura, and they can be anywhere from three to nine feet tall. Some people can even see the aura of others, and it’s possible to strengthen this ability in yourself.\nTo read the full article on YogiApproved, click  here!\n","date":1618185600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618185600,"objectID":"e8ae89adb61caf2778bec70456518f4a","permalink":"https://ruhahealing.com/post/eighth-chakra-aura-/","publishdate":"2021-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/eighth-chakra-aura-/","section":"post","summary":"We have already talked about the eighth chakra in one of my last articles. Today we look at the most important things once again together with the online magazine @ YogiApproved, where I published this article.","tags":[],"title":"Did You Know You Have an Eighth Chakra?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"Term Kriya The word Kriya can be translated as \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo;. In Kundalini Yoga, it usually means a complete series of exercises.\nThis specific action is seen as the origin, a seed, so to speak, from which something much greater can blossom. This image already shows how much power there is in a Kriya. Practicing a Kriya can enable you to do many things, it makes you grow and sooner or later changes your reality.\nKriya in the context of Kundalini Yoga As already mentioned, the Kriya in Kundalini Yoga is a whole series of exercises, i.e. often a sequence of specific postures as well as breathing and sound. The individual specific Kriyas represent a respective unity and stand for themselves. Behind each Kriya is a goal, a direction, which you can ideally engage in.\nA single Kriya in Kundalini Yoga is often repeated over several days, weeks or even months. In this way, you can repeat each Kriya regularly to explore the depth that lies within the Kriya and eventually master it. In doing so, you can open up to new levels of consciousness of your Self and reach a certain state. Each Kriya is balanced in itself and should be practiced exactly as it is written. If you strictly follow the instructions that each Kriya implies, you will be able to achieve the desired goal of it.\nWhat does a Kriya do to you? Feeling the depth and meaning of the Kriya through your yoga practice is one thing. The next is that you should also be aware of the magnitude beyond that. Experiencing Kriyas in Kundalini Yoga can also affect your life in general. It is quite possible that you will become more and more in harmony, your life will experience wholeness and your actions will experience appropriateness as you may never have felt before. Through this feeling and anchoring in your Self, grace and dignity eventually emerge throughout your body. You are powerful and endowed with the ability to accomplish things, to use actions appropriately - timeless and timely at the same time.\nSome postures in Kundalini Yoga may feel uncomfortable to you and others may feel very pleasant. Everyone feels the effects of each posture individually, because this is also related to your previous experiences and of course these are not congruent for anyone.\nIn fact, you can use Kundalini Yoga as a tool for self-diagnosis: Your sensations and feelings during the postures, the Kriya, can give you information about the state of your body, your muscles and glands, and your emotions.\nCentral to Kundalini Yoga practice is your devotion. When you surrender to a Kriya to the highest degree possible, you are most likely to feel the effects of it within you.\nFeel invited to practice a Kriya and experience what it means to engage in this specific sequence of actions. In my following Youtube video - a recording of my live session - I guide you through the \u0026ldquo;Nabhi Kriya for Prana and Apana\u0026rdquo;. This works on your life energy (Prana) and your energy to let go things (Apana). Both energies are important for you.\nGet involved and have this experience with yourself. How do you feel afterwards? Feel exactly inside yourself, use this opportunity and above all: be honest with yourself!\nThis can be YOUR chance and it\u0026rsquo;s up to you if you take it\u0026hellip;.\n If it feels right, continue! Practice this Kriya again tomorrow, in a few days or make another video. And if you want more, sign up for my regular online live Yoga sessions. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to welcome you there and guide you on your path.\nSat Nam!\n","date":1615507200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615507200,"objectID":"cc5b1356a973232a42d0984d840d7495","permalink":"https://ruhahealing.com/post/understanding_kriya/","publishdate":"2021-03-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/understanding_kriya/","section":"post","summary":"As you may know, in Kundalini Yoga we practice a wide variety of Kriyas. But what exactly does it mean to go through a KRIYA?","tags":null,"title":"Understanding KRIYA","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"First, let\u0026rsquo;s look at what exactly is behind your mind. Do you have any idea about it? Your mind is a complex entity and governs you in many ways.\nThe Mind 🤯 Your mind serves your soul and produces many more thoughts than you could ever process. It is automatic, always active, and almost overwhelms you with thoughts. It is your mind that thinks instead of you. There are also thoughts that do not support your true self, what you are. In short, the mind brings with it its pitfalls, so it is good to understand it all the more and use it to your advantage.\nAnother important characteristic of the mind is its urge to polarize. This means that it prefers to sort everything into good and bad, positive and negative. Thus, your mind is always looking for contrasts in order to be able to classify things. And this works best through constant movement, so to speak always on the search.\nYou can understand your mind as its own structure, process or current, which you can observe yourself and finally also change. You can achieve changes, for example, through your own thoughts, conscious breathing or meditation.\nConsequently, it is important that you understand the structure of your mind itself and discover thought origins in order to finally decide for yourself which thoughts are in accordance with and correspond to your true self. By clearly perceiving your thoughts, you can orient yourself to your soul and consciously follow its path. Consequently, you will also be able to perceive an awakening of your intuition, which will support you in living out your destiny.\nAll this is a complex process, because to observe your mind you need your mind, which in turn seems incredibly strong and almost unpredictable. Techniques to control your mind are mainly meditations, breath control and mantras. Through these you can find a certain zero point, a place where your mind is still. There is calmness there \u0026hellip;\nIn this maelstrom and labyrinth of thoughts about thoughts and the desire to control them, it can become exhausting to stay with it and to deal with your own thought structures. To understand this a bit more, the three aspects of the mind are also important: Your mind is namely divided into negative, positive and neutral.\nThe negative mind ➖ Negative mind may sound negative to you at first, but it is not per se. Your negative mind is just as important as your positive and neutral mind and all 3 aspects are present in you.\nWhat exactly does it mean that a part of your mind is negative? The negative mind is also called the protective mind, which describes its relevance quite well. It serves you to protect you from danger, so that you simply survive. It lays its protective hand over everything that could threaten, disturb or destroy you. Thus its motto is rather negation. Thereby the protecting mind mainly refers to past experiences and wants to help you e.g. by a no-signal that you do not get involved in a certain thing, because the mind has internalized due to made experiences that this will not be good for you. The main motivation of this mechanism is pure protection and to preserve the high good of life. At the same time, your negative mind is mainly connected to your subconscious mind. Also, inherent in this aspect of your mind is a deep longing for belonging. The highest form of this connection you can make is with your higher self.\nSat Nam!\nThe positive mind ➕ As you already know, your mind is not only negative, but also positive oriented. These two aspects seem like two opposite ends. But are they?\nThe positive mind is the expansive part of your mind. It is in search of pleasure and fulfillment. In contrast to the reactive negative mind, the positive mind is active, risk-taking and constructive. It rather sends yes-messages and encourages you to do things, freely according to the motto \u0026ldquo;Come what may\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Everything is possible\u0026rdquo;. In this way, the expansive mind strengthens your thoughts and tempts you into a constant saying yes, if it is very pronounced. It thus gives you a strong will and generates strong, direct communication. It is also characterized by expansion and the ability to let resources in. There is a strong reference to the future, behind which there is certainly a certain curiosity.\nAll in all, it becomes clear that the two aspects negative and positive are relatively opposed to each other, since they pursue completely different goals and function fundamentally differently.\nThe neutral mind 🙏 But how can you combine both influences, positive and negative, and make decisions? For this you have your neutral mind.\nThis part is also called meditative mind. It has the power to judge and assess. It does not pursue its own goal and is not attached to your reality. It has the ability to observe the actions of negative and positive mind, without joining one part directly. It can decide for you which direction is better for you - and that within 9 seconds. Relevant for the meditative mind is only your higher self, with which it is connected. However, this connection can be more or less strong. It is important to train and strengthen this aspect of your mind so that you can live your life in the greatest possible harmony with your higher self and ultimately your destiny. Your view will become more intuitive and you will be able to touch your soul. Thus, the neutral mind is characterized by consciousness and has access to the soul.\nWhat do these insights into the mind mean for you? As already mentioned, all these parts are also present in you. The individual aspects are developed differently in every person. Maybe you have a feeling for it, how the situation is with your mind currently\u0026hellip;.\nBasically it is the case that EVERY thought is filtered through the negative, positive and neutral mind. Your neutral mind then makes - provided it is developed accordingly - the decision that is best for you.\nThrough a developed neutral mind you stay centered, whole and together. The whole experience can be enjoyed in this way. But this neutral state of mind must first be developed, trained, experienced and refined. After that, any success in life is possible. Through the practice of Kundalini Yoga and meditation, you can develop and train your neutral mind and with it the capacity for intelligence, perseverance and integrity. Meditating on a regular basis is one of the most important fundaments for a strong and supporting neutral mind. Finally, with the neutral mind you can establish an intuitive way of seeing as well as access to your own soul. Your actions in this state are dignified and follow your heart as well as your soul. Your own light can penetrate outward and thus infect other lights, other souls. 🔆 Doesn\u0026rsquo;t that sound wonderful?\nYou are welcome to join my regular Kundalini Yoga sessions. The best way to register for them is here. Of course, you can also send me an email.\n🎁 As a newcomer, your first lesson is a free gift from me to you.\nI am convinced that the regular practice of Kundalini Yoga strengthens your neutral mind, but also brings other manifold positive effects. In each session there is also a part at the end where we meditate. By meditating again and again, you are also doing something good for your whole system. Thus, a Kundalini Yoga class is a wonderful overall package for you to get closer to yourself and to follow the path of your soul.\nWahe Guru!\n","date":1613520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613520000,"objectID":"9cd2c866ad3a1811a8e87df25c099973","permalink":"https://ruhahealing.com/post/get-to-know-your-mind/index.md/","publishdate":"2021-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/get-to-know-your-mind/index.md/","section":"post","summary":"In Kundalini Yoga we talk about the 3 facets of the mind. You can get to know them right here.","tags":[],"title":"Get to know your mind","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"Meditating has been with me for a couple of years now and over time I have become more and more immersed in this fascinating subject. You can meditate in many different ways - including the Kundalini Yoga way. 😉 But first let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at what exactly it means to meditate.\nMeaning of meditation First of all, meditating is a process that enables you to control and eventually overcome your thought waves. Every second your mind produces new thoughts, so you find yourself in a sea of them. By consciously meditating, you can order this sea and bring it to rest. This allows your soul to shine. It can then shape its path, its destiny, in a more focused way.\nEffects of meditating What else does the act of meditating bring? There is a long list of positive effects on your system. I will present you the most important ones here.\n  Development of your neutral mind. This is also called the meditative mind. It is important to make decisions in your life as neutral as possible - without positive or negative influences - and aligned with the purpose of your soul.\n  Increased well-being, inner peace, stability and tranquility. By controlling your multiple thoughts, you inevitably attain a more peaceful state and radiate more and more tranquility to the outside world.\n  Developing your intuition. Your intuition has an enormously important power, as it guides you to where your soul wants to go. Unfortunately, many people lose the connection to their own intuition and act increasingly from the mind. A reconnection to as well as expansion of your intuition will come about through regular meditation.\n  Promoting mental clarity, mental awareness and existence in the present. Through meditation you will learn to overcome your thoughts. That is, you no longer allow yourself to be so strongly guided by your random thoughts, but take the helm yourself, so to speak. You act more and more consciously and clearly and can thereby perceive yourself and your environment in the here and now.\n  Development of the frontal lobe of the anterior brain. Here, among other things, the seat of your personality is located, as well as a great connection to your executive functions. Abilities in this area are therefore promoted.\n  Positive influence on blood pressure, cholesterol level and immune system. The resulting relaxation probably allows narrowed blood vessels to dilate again, so that your blood pressure is lowered. In addition, stress increases your susceptibility to disease because your immune system is weaker. Meditation reduces your perception of stress, which improves the performance of your immune system. Since stress also causes high cholesterol, the process of meditation lowers it as well as blood pressure.\n  Clearing the mind. By directing your thoughts and letting them pass you by more instead of taking them in, you keep your subconscious mind cleaner. These passing thoughts can\u0026rsquo;t even penetrate your system deeply enough to seek out your subconscious mind. By doing this, you purify your mind.\n  So you see, the activity of meditating - especially regularly - brings many beneficial effects. I can only say: It is worth it!\nTypes of meditation in Kundalini Yoga You can meditate in many different ways, which is what Kundalini Yoga likes to do. There are two basic distinctions to make: meditating with or without a mantra. The selection of possible mantras in Kundalini Yoga is relatively large, so you can certainly find a mantra that resonates with you and moves you forward, making your soul shine.\nMoreover, you can meditate not only while sitting, but also while walking or with a partner facing you (then sitting again). There are also meditations in which a deep gong is played or where you use a mala (certain chain of beads that you hold in your hand). In my opinion, especally the gong meditation really has something very magical. Also the so-called \u0026ldquo;celestial comunication\u0026rdquo;, i.e. the connection of mantra and movement, is a form of meditation in Kundalini Yoga.\n11-day meditation challenge At the end of last year, I offered a meditation challenge online. In this challenge we did the same meditation (from Kundalini Yoga) together for 11 days and 11 minutes each day, namely the \u0026ldquo;Meditation to see the unseen\u0026rdquo;. This meditation does not use a mantra, but special arm and hand postures. The left arm is positioned next to the torso and the left hand is brought into Surya Mudra (thumb and ring finger connected). The right arm is extended straight forward with the palm facing upward forming a small cup. You close your eyes in this position and then focus on your moon center, which is your chin. You can see a picture of the position at the beginning of this post and my video of it right here. 👇\n The most exciting thing is your own development over these 11 days in using meditation. You can feel through repeated practice exactly what the meditation is doing to you, where it is working, how you are taking on the challenge each day and eventually mastering it. After 11 days, you will definitely come out powerful if you have been able to engage in the process of meditating. It\u0026rsquo;s all worth a try!\nThis meditation challenge really bonded us all together and almost all participants were live every day. So we felt more supported by the group and accepted this challenge together, even if in the end of course everyone was allowed to master the task for themselves. After 11 days all participants were satisfied and proud of themselves, but at the same time a little sad that the time of meditating together was now over. Of course, everyone can continue to practice with the video I provided, but it is something different to come together live, meditate and feel connected in a special way.\nSo I have decided to offer a new 11-day meditation challenge to open the space for this again. This time we will practice a different meditation, which again lasts 11 minutes. This one also works on your nervous system and strengthens it. In addition, this meditation is said to have a rejuvenating effect. So then, let\u0026rsquo;s go, or what are you still thinking about? 😉\nTo join the upcoming Kundalini Yoga meditation, you can simply send me an email or contact me via my social media channels facebook, twitter or instagram. 🙏🏽 Then you will receive all the necessary details and after receipt of payment also the access link.\nI am really looking forward to meet you and to start this meditation journey together with you. 🙏\nSat Nam!\n","date":1611619200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611619200,"objectID":"2b4cd954d31ac2a5f1604a06f824b20b","permalink":"https://ruhahealing.com/post/11-day-meditation-challenge/","publishdate":"2021-01-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/11-day-meditation-challenge/","section":"post","summary":"Meditating has a lot of great effects on your whole body-mind-soul-system, especially when done on a regular basis.

In fact, this practice was previously only available to selected yogis, and therefore, rather secret.\nBut Yogi Bhajan’s goal was to train more teachers instead of gathering a bunch of students around him.\nSince first being introduced to the West, the practice of Kundalini Yoga has become more and more popular and many people have deeply benefited from this unique yoga practice.\nWhat Is the Origin of Kundalini Yoga? Kundalini Yoga has been practiced for thousands of years. It’s a tradition with a long lineage passed down through many teachers.\nIt speaks of a “golden chain” as a link to all previous and current teachers. This gives Kundalini Yoga a deeply spiritual aspect.\nIt is believed that practicing Kundalini Yoga can lead you to your awakened inner identity.\nWhat Does “Kundalini” Mean? The word Kundalini comes from Sanskrit and is translated as “rolled up; sleeping snake power.” Every human being carries this power, the Kundalini energy or consciousness energy, within him or herself. It is a creative force.\nThe Kundalini is also called the nerve of the soul, which can be awakened. With the awakening of this energy, the yogi attains a higher level of consciousness. Therefore, Kundalini Yoga is also often called the “yoga of consciousness”.\nKundalini Yoga represents the highest technique that can awaken your consciousness and your soul. Through this process of awareness, you can unfold your very own truth that naturally lives within you.\nThe practice is considered a safe way to activate this creative force within you – without losing your hold on the earth.\nWhat Happens in a Kundalini Yoga Class? \u0026hellip;\nTo read the full article on YogiApproved, click  here!\n","date":1609200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609200000,"objectID":"80098cba771730ec66542dfc155c06ad","permalink":"https://ruhahealing.com/post/curious-about-kundalini-yoga/","publishdate":"2020-12-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/curious-about-kundalini-yoga/","section":"post","summary":"Kundalini Yoga is considered as special and kind of royal. Get an insight right here and feel invited to read my full article in the online magazine @YogiApproved.","tags":[],"title":"Curious about Kundalini Yoga?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"If someone asked me which form of breathing I like best in Kundalini Yoga, I would definitely answer: \u0026ldquo;The breath of fire\u0026quot;. In the following I will tell you why I think so.\nIf you practice yoga, you may have heard about the technique of the breath of fire - also known as \u0026ldquo;Agni Pran\u0026rdquo; - or have used it yourself. Especially in Kundalini Yoga many different breathing techniques are used, which stimulate and support your whole body-mind-soul system in different ways. Today I will deepen with you the insight into the power of the breath of fire.\n🔥 How does the breath of fire work? Let us start directly with the most important point: the technique. You can best feel all the energy of the breath of fire if you execute this breathing pattern correctly.\nSit upright in a comfortable sitting position (on your yoga mat or chair/sofa) and stretch your back. Your head will rise and your buttocks will remain firmly rooted to the base of your seat. Your breath flows through your nose as you breathe in and out. Your mouth is closed. First, consciously perceive the flow of your breath. When breathing in, breathe deeply into your stomach, when breathing out, pull your navel slightly inwards towards your spine and press the last air out of your lungs. Connect with the power of your navel. Place one or both hands on your stomach to feel the bulging and contraction directly. Now slowly increase your breathing speed so that your breaths become shorter. Increase the pace until you inhale and exhale about 2-3 times per second, i.e. 2-3 breathing cycles. You can perceive that the breath of fire is a fast, rhythmic and continuous breathing pattern. Make sure that inhalation and exhalation are of equal length. During the practice of the breath of fire you will be able to perceive the movement of your belly, because the breath of fire emanates from this area. As you exhale, focus on expelling the air powerfully through your nose by pulling your navel point inward toward your spine. Inhalation is automatic to a certain extent, but you must not remain without attention. This will relax your upper abdominal muscles so that your diaphragm can descend again. Keep your chest slightly elevated. Your chest remains relaxed while you breathe in.\nExplanation VIDEO for you 👇\n 🔆 What effects does the breath of fire have? The list of positive effects on your entire system from practicing the breath of fire is quite long. If you practice this breathing technique regularly and correctly, you can benefit from these effects:\n Toxins and deposits from your lungs, mucous membranes, blood vessels and other cells are released. The breath of fire has a very cleansing and detoxifying effect. Your lung capacity expands. Your life force or energy (Pran(a)) increases. You will experience a strengthening of your nervous system and an increase in its resistance to stress. A balance between your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is established. Your navel chakra is strengthened and thus brings you (more) into your own middle. You become centered. There is an increase in your physical stamina. Your actions become more effective. Your aura experiences an alignment of its subtle psycho-electromagnetic field, which leads to the energization of your blood. Any craving for drugs, tobacco or bad food is reduced. The oxygen supply to your brain is increased, which supports your concentrated, neutral mind. Your immune system is strengthened. The synchronization of the biorhythms of your body systems is promoted. You feel warmth coming up inside you. Your blood circulation improves and your circulation is strengthened. Your fat and cell metabolism and digestion are stimulated. This form of breathing helps against asthma. You reduce anger and rage, become more satisfied and feel more joy.  This is an amazing list of effects. Who would not like to benefit from them?\nWahe Guru! 🙏\nAre there any \u0026ldquo;side effects\u0026rdquo;? Especially in the beginning, when you are not that familiar with the breath of fire, you may feel dizzy. Then you should take a break and return to long, deep breathing. If you experience other discomfort or tingling, these are normal symptoms. This is your body showing you that it is getting used to the new breathing technique and that your nerves are being invigorated. The focus on your 3rd eye can help you to stay focused. In general, such symptoms decrease if you drink a lot of water and change your diet to light food. Depending on what you have been \u0026ldquo;giving\u0026rdquo; to your body so far, toxins may also be released into your body.\n🚫 Limitations in the practice of the breath of fire There are also states of your body that restrict you in the practice of the breath of fire. Several of these primarily affect the women among us.If you are pregnant, you should generally NOT practice breath of fire. Instead, you can use long, deep breathing. During your menstruation it is recommended, especially in the first 1-3 days (depending on the intensity), not to practice breath of fire. However, I would like to deliberately leave this decision to each woman on her own, as each woman experiences the state of her menstruation differently. If you are a woman going through menopause and are experiencing hot flashes, this is another condition where you should use the breat of fire more critically. The breath of fire heats up your body even more, which can be too much for you at that moment. If you have high blood pressure, you should also be careful with the breath of fire - this applies to men and women alike - as it can increase your blood pressure.\nIt is best to actively feel inside yourself each time and then decide if and how intensively you want to practice the breath of fire on that day.\n⚡ Can something be done wrong? Yes. The practice of breath of fire is facing certain difficulties, which I would like to point out to you very clearly.\nA common breathing mistake is the paradoxical breath. In this case, the stomach goes inwards when breathing in and the chest rises; when breathing out, the stomach goes outwards and the chest lowers again. This pattern is exactly the opposite of how the breath should proceed. This is the way your breath should actually go: When you breathe in, the belly bulges outward and when you breathe out, it moves inward. If you experience paradoxical breathing, it is best to place one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest. In this way you can adjust your breath and consciously and slowly start with the breath of fire.\nSometimes you may also use exaggerated abdominal movements, similar to a bellows. However, the breath of fire is not bellows breathing. It is created a little higher near the solar plexus. Again, consciously feel inside yourself and perceive the center of the breath of fire for yourself.\nYour attention to the balance between inhalation and exhalation may decrease. In this case it is recommended to first exaggerate both parts one after the other, i.e. more inhalation than exhalation and then more exhalation than inhalation. In this way you should directly feel the effects of the overemphasis of the respective breathing parts, so that your feeling for the right balance can increase. Pay attention to the sound of your breathing and let a steady rhythm develop.\nYou tense your face. This is an indication that you are using your navel incorrectly. Your face should be soft and relaxed during the breath of fire, just as it is during the long deep breathing. Keep consciously feeling into your energy centers in your abdomen and upper body and perceive your face.\n❗ In general, it is important to start slowly as a beginner in the practice of breath of fire and become familiar with the technique. Approach slowly and increase the pace only when you have developed a feeling for the breath of fire. Over time, you will be able to feel the benefits of the breath of fire more directly and consciously. You can then enjoy these effects very intensely.\nI wish you a lot of joy in getting to know \u0026amp; practicing the breath of fire! 💫\nPlease also pay attention that this guide for breath of fire and your use of it is a decision you have to take on your own. I cannot promise to you that you\u0026rsquo;ll feel these benefits as well, as every human being is unique and therefore reacts individually. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure, if you can practice the breath of fire, please ask your doctor (as mentioned in my disclaimer). ☝️\nSAT NAM!\n","date":1607040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607040000,"objectID":"78aa32edaa36e6d630fb6eff5f4e7661","permalink":"https://ruhahealing.com/post/breath_of_fire/","publishdate":"2020-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/breath_of_fire/","section":"post","summary":"Read about this strong breathing technique you can use for your daily practice.

Many chakra theories and also illustrations do not include the aura as the 8th chakra. In Kundalini Yoga, however, the aura has an equally important role as all other seven chakras that I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about before.\nThe aura is located outside of your body. It is related to your radiation. The color of the aura is white and is located in the electromagnetic field of your body. It is not associated with any of the elements, but simply \u0026ldquo;only\u0026rdquo; with the feeling of being. The aura gives you the space for yourself and fills it with yourself, with your presence.\nIn the eighth chakra the effects of all other chakras are brought together. The aura also represents the power of the energy sphere that surrounds all other seven chakras, a kind of surrounding field. Within the specific energy of the aura, the universal flow of energy becomes fixed. You can feel deep connectedness within you through the power of your aura, as it interweaves you with the entire universe.\nEveryone has an aura, some can even see the aura of others. You can also strengthen this ability within yourself. Auras can be between three and nine feet in size.\nIn addition, the element water is good for your aura, for example when you go into the water, take a shower or a bath. This can change your aura. Likewise, drinking water and letting water out of your body purifies you and your aura and changes your emotions.\nYour aura is your protective body and also your projection body that surrounds you.\nA strong aura \u0026hellip; … provides you with the ability to filter out negative influences from your surroundings. Your other chakras can work better together. It creates a connection to the integrity of the electromagnetic field of your body. Your surrounding field will look round and symmetrical, provided you are healthy. Then your presence alone will work for you. This means that universal forces will be directed to serve you, to fulfill your wishes and needs.\nA weak aura \u0026hellip; … on the other hand, makes you vulnerable to all external influences. When you are sick, your aura has bulges with weaker radiance and even holes. It is then possible that you feel vulnerable, live a more withdrawn life and appear shy.\nKundalini Yoga \u0026amp; Aura Also in connection with this chakra, your aura, you can use practices from the colorful world of Kundalini Yoga. To strengthen your aura, the following exercises from Kundalini Yoga can support you well if necessary:\n Triangel Pose Ego Eradicator Archer Pose All arm exercises All meditations  As usual, this list of exercises is not a panacea. Please always look for yourself individually, what exactly you can do in which way. If you are uncertain, please always consult your doctor.\nDuring a Kundalini Yoga class different chakras are usually touched and activated, often with a focus.

Curious about it?","tags":[],"title":"The eighth chakra","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"The journey through the eight chakras in Kundalini Yoga continues. Today the focus lies on the crown chakra as a very important central chakra. It is located at the vertex of the head and also above it and therefore slightly outside the body. In Sanskrit this chakra is called \u0026ldquo;Sahasrara\u0026rdquo;, which can be translated as \u0026ldquo;thousand times\u0026rdquo;.\nOrganically, the crown chakra is associated with the brain and especially the pineal gland. The chakra is represented with the color violet. As an element in a broader sense, the cosmos is associated here. Thematically, the seventh chakra covers the areas of consciousness, fulfillment, spirituality and divine guidance. Through this chakra, a connection is created between humanity and divinity, to the greater whole, the cosmic consciousness. Through this it is possible for us to gain access to the highest form of wisdom and knowledge - through the process of fusion and unity. It is about understanding beyond the possibilities and limitations of the mind. Important is also the activity and opening of the already known six other chakras. The crown chakra cannot be consciously controlled in this sense - in contrast to the other six \u0026ldquo;underlying\u0026rdquo; chakras. In addition, the kundalini energy, which has already risen through the other chakras, comes together here. After this ascent, the kundalini energy moves back down to the root chakra. Moreover, the hormonal balance and the balance in the entire body system are also regulated here.\nAnother important aspect of the crown chakra is humility and devotion, which is shown by bowing to infinity. Here you can also find an explanation for bowing: The vertex and thus seat of the seventh chakra is brought down to the earth when bowing. This creates a center of attention and direction of flow of the blood. New feelings of openness and strength can be conveyed through it.\nIn general, when strengthening the crown chakra, care must be taken to avoid the development of a spiritual ego. Here humility plays an important role in order not to gain the spiritual powers for the ego and for the sake of power. A connection to integrity and wholeness is accordingly important.\nWhen your crown chakra is open \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; you experience the holistic transcendence of your identity as a separate person. This step of development is often called enlightenment. You feel a feeling of boundlessness, without limitations. The world can be understood beyond your own mind. The intensive connection with the spiritual world enables a deep feeling of inner peace, completely connected with divine love. Thus, fears on the inside become a strange, unrelated feeling. The opening of the crown chakra also means an opening towards the divine guidance in your own life. Everything that exists is perceived in unity and connectedness. Other people are met with compassion and tolerance. There is no urge (anymore) to change the fellow human beings. Life contexts are understood deeper and deeper on the spiritual level.\nCan your Sahasrara also be blocked? In this chakra there exists more of an underdevelopment than a mere blockage or disorder. This underdevelopment seems to be widespread. If a lot of anger accumulates in someone and this anger is projected in a diffuse way to a higher force, this can lead to a total aversion and rejection of a connection to the Divine. On a psychological level, being cut off can lead to disorientation, spiritual emptiness and finally uprooting. Then the feeling of leading a meaningless life and ignorance of the true self can be present.\nMain characteristics of the crown chakra  Sanskrit: Sahasrara Position: at and above the vertex of the head Color: Purple Element: Cosmos Psychological function: Self-knowledge Challenge: Attachment Universal identity \u0026ldquo;I understand.\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;I have the right to know.\u0026rdquo;  Kundalini Yoga \u0026amp; Sahasrara The practice of specific exercises from Kundalini Yoga can help you to open your crown chakra.\n Ego Eradicator Mahaband Sat Kriya Concentration on the tip of the nose All meditations  As usual, this list of exercises is not a panacea.

You may have heard about this specific term, which is especially used in the world of Kundalini Yoga. But what’s that all about?\nIn this article you will find a basic presentation of Sadhana as a core theme from Kundalini Yoga. You will learn what is done in Sadhana, what effects this can have, and how you can practice your own Sadhana.\nWhat is Sadhana? Sadhana means daily spiritual practice. The aspect of “daily” is not to be neglected at all, since you will create an important foundation through a very regular practice of spirituality.\nThis requires a certain amount of self-discipline, which in turn, gives you the opportunity to express infinity in your own self.\nIn Kundalini Yoga, the practice of Sadhana has an important meaning, which is why it’s recommended to all yogis and yoginis.\nThrough Sadhana, you open yourself up to the possibility to perceive and finally overcome any patterns that lead you away from your higher consciousness. It is a consciously performed practice that is meant to serve you.\nHere are the 6 steps of a traditional Kundalini Sadhana: Classically, in the two and a half hours before sunrise, you practice the following things in this specific order.\n  Recitation The Japji Sahib is a prayer from Sikhism, which is recited and chanted in a meditative way at the start of the day.\n  Chanting The “Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo” mantra is used to begin all Kundalini practices.\n  Kriya Next, you practice a Kriya of Kundalini Yoga to keep your physical body fit, strengthen circulation, release tension, and stimulate the Kundalini energy within you. A Kriya consists of movements, breathwork, chanting, and meditation. The choice of the Kriya is not prescribed, although certain Kriyas are particularly suitable for Sadhana. Those that work on the respiration, glands, nerves, and spine in a balanced way are especially useful. The Kriya should be generally energizing.

","tags":[],"title":"What is SADHANA?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"Having already got to know the fifth chakra as the beginning of the upper triangle, you can now explore the sixth chakra, the brow chakra. In Sanskrit the brow chakra is known as \u0026ldquo;Ajna\u0026rdquo;, which translated means \u0026ldquo;to command\u0026rdquo;. Therefore the sixth chakra is also called the command chakra. Even better known is the name \u0026ldquo;third eye\u0026rdquo;, which is a very common term for many yogis \u0026amp; yoginis.\nThe brow chakra is located, as can be assumed, in the area of the forehead between and slightly above the eyebrows. Organically, the brain and especially the pituitary gland (hypophysis) are assigned to this chakra. In the spectrum of colors we are now in the range of indigo (dark purple). In addition, this chakra is often represented by light - as an assigned characteristic. Here the inner light is meant. The elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether) are left with the third eye, which means we are now moving outside the five elements that can be related to the previous chakras.\nThe main focus of the third eye is on intuition, but also wisdom and identity. Through the brow chakra you can gain integrity and intuition and get a feeling for them, and finally go your very own way, to take the direction of your soul. Your soul can thus be guided by your intuition. The brow chakra is also called the gateway to the soul and thus to higher spiritual experiences.\nYour third eye is also for setting goals and anticipating the long-term effects of your actions. This chakra is therefore also characterized by cultivation and projection.\nThe two physical eyes allow us to see into the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; world, but the third eye goes beyond that. It gives us *depth, vision and scope into the subtle worlds. The sense and perception itself is expanded far beyond physical reality. An opening to divine consciousness and the higher dimensions is then possible. Herein lies the origin of knowledge and the experience of being more than just your own body.\nThe brow chakra is represented by two petals, as you can see in the picture. These symbolise the duality of mind that needs to be overcome. Duality is that every thought consists of a plus and a minus. When you master the sixth chakra, the opposites of life will no longer confuse you. You will be equipped with the ability to read between the polarities or lines. Interestingly, the associated gland, the pituitary gland, also consists of two parts: anterior and posterior pituitary. Thus, an existing duality is even visible in our body.\nThe unification of opposites is also addressed here. Thus, the three main energy channels Ida, Pingala and Sushmana flow together here.\nWhen your third eye is open\u0026hellip; \u0026hellip;then deep spiritual realms of experience will be revealed to you. You are characterized by clairvoyance, imagination and a good visualization. You can perceive ideas as inner pictures and let your own intuition lead you. Here in the third eye is the centre of your intuition, with which you get in touch. This is accompanied by a good imagination. You will also be focused and determined and move through your life in a self-initiated way. You will understand the meaning and content of your life with an open brow chakra, i.e. with access to your intuition and wisdom. You can attain awareness of the Divine within yourself and in everything that surrounds you and us. Deep spiritual experiences of cosmic consciousness are made possible for you. Likewise, a close communication with your soul is established and you become noticeably more sensitive to your intuition the more your Ajna is opened. For some people even telepathic communication is possible.\nAjna in imbalance With a disturbed brow chakra, states of confusion and depression are possible. The own thoughts then often revolve around fears and worries, which leads to a kind of mental forlornness and lack of orientation. As a result, feelings of senselessness arise, which have a corresponding effect on the state of mind. In addition, lack of concentration, illusionary realities, nightmares, delusions and even hallucinations can occur. The brow chakra is then active, but in a disturbed way. Furthermore, spirituality is often rejected by people with a blocked Ajna. This is because everything is much more viewed from the material and mind-controlled, intellectual level. Therefore, only that which is visible, measurable or has an analytical background has value. This then leads to an excess of intellectualization because the intellectual mind is overemphasized. There is the eternal attempt to have to understand everything rationally. Things and events are always questioned mentally. The reason for this can partly be the educated world view and belief system.\nMain characteristics of the Third Eye  Sanskrit: Ajna Position: Forehead, between the eyebrows Color: Indigo Element: Light Psychological function: Self-reflection Challenge: Illusions Archetypal identity \u0026ldquo;I see.\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;I have the right to see.\u0026rdquo;  Kundalini Yoga \u0026amp; Ajna The practice of specific exercises from Kundalini Yoga can help you to open or rebalance your brow chakra.\n Meditations on the third eye Long chanting Kirtan Kriya Archer Pose Whistling Breathing Exercises Yoga mudra All exercises with the forehead on the floor  Especially the chanting of \u0026ldquo;Ong\u0026rdquo; stimulates the cave in the cranium where the pituitary gland is located.

The main attention here is on intuition and the connection to your soul.","tags":[],"title":"The sixth chakra","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"With the fifth chakra, after the lower triangle, the second triangle begins, which can be found among the chakras: the upper triangle. This fifth chakra, known as the throat chakra, is called \u0026ldquo;Vissudha\u0026rdquo; in Sanskrit. Translated this means purity. The upper and lower triangle are connected by Anahata, the heart chakra.\nThe throat chakra, as the name suggests, is located in the throat centre. On an organic level, the thyroid and parathyroid glands, trachea, throat and neck vertebrae are connected to this chakra. The colour for this chakra is light blue. On a sensual level this is the level of hearing. 👂🏽\nThe central theme of the throat chakra is the projected power of the word, which means hearing and speaking the truth. It is also about the expression of the soul and expressiveness in general, but also about authenticity, truth and higher self.\nHere, experiences of your self-expression are processed, whereby it is mainly about the highest expression of your soul. A connection with the higher mind can be established if your throat chakra is permeable. Herein lies the source of understanding and the ability to communicate. Your very own search for truth lies hidden in this chakra and can be carried outwards through your communication as well as through contacts and wishes. With the help of this specific energy from the throat chakra you can achieve self-determination, freedom and independence. You can re-evaluate any beliefs you have learned through your own truth filter and thus live out these values. Consequently, there is room for the expression of your soul\u0026rsquo;s individuality - through communication or creative self-expression like for example dance or art. 💃🏽\nThe connection with your higher self is made possible through the throat chakra. Through this, soul messages as well as your own destiny can be felt free of any conditions. The identification with your own ego can be transcended through this chakra so that you can live your true self. An opening to the higher levels of the subtle dimension is also made possible. Now the greater connection behind all things can be recognized.\nJust say it! Let\u0026rsquo;s dive deeper into the realm of communication, of language. Everything starts with your spoken word (Vaak Siddhi), which is the highest of all seeds (Bija). This is the power that initiates manifestations of physical forms or actions solely through the utterance of the words. These are then the seeds for the emerging manifestations. Transmitted this means that the power of man is so strong when it comes to determining the direction of an action. The seeds are planted and from that moment on they are handed over to the laws of Maya. From then on it is difficult to change the course of events, because things have already been set in motion, the seed has already spread its roots and growth is taking place. 🌱\nThe spoken word stands for power to plant the seeds, which in turn can fulfill the highest destiny of someone. So if the word is mastered and with it the ability to initiate the actions that come out of the soul, then the gate to the higher regions of this upper triangle can be opened. This is why the throat chakra is also called an enormous gate. The power of projection is also not to be despised here. Communication in general is rather blunt, according to the motto \u0026ldquo;So be it\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen the throat chakra is open \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; then you experience the perception of the subtle and are able to express yourself and your own truth. You can express sensations, feelings and attitudes freely and openly and have a preference for communication itself. This also means that disputes are not problems in themselves, as they are usually considered to broaden horizons. Speaking clearly and getting things to the point is generally not difficult. But it is also easy to listen, and this also means being able to understand other people - as well as yourself - from a higher perspective. At the same time, the own weaknesses are also accepted. People with an open throat chakra can improvise well. Furthermore, openness towards different kinds of inspiration prevails. The own wishes and the ability to manifest and fulfil them in the own life are perceived. Basically, the expression of the own intuition or soul is undisturbed. You can let yourself be led trustingly by your inner guidance, your intuition. With this you are authentic to yourself as well as to others and are in a more integral connection to your soul. It comes to an end of the identification with the ego, which enables the opening for the pure expression of the soul.\nOut of balance If, on the other hand, the throat chakra is disturbed, this can be due to painful experiences and a lack of self-expression as the being you are. Especially difficult life situations at the age of 16 to 21 years can have a negative effect on the development of the throat chakra and inhibit developments. The consequences are, for example, a disturbed self-expression and a disturbed communication with the environment. In addition, needs, wishes etc. cannot be communicated and others cannot be listened to. The inner fear of contact with others can then lead to inhibitions, which can also be explained by fear of rejection, criticism, loss of control and negative reactions in general. These fears, in turn, can lead to constructs of lies, exaggerations and even bizarre self-dramatization. In addition to uptightness, apathy can also occur in some cases. This whole behaviour serves as a protection, because nobody else is shown with the true self. To the outside world these people do not show themselves clearly.\nFurthermore, there is often no access to the inner self and no trust in the own intuition. The self-confidence is low or even non-existent. In extreme cases, speech disorders occur. The world is also often perceived as colourless and poor, as the ability to dream, try out and improvise is rather poor. All this leaves pain for the own soul and can lead to remorse, self-condemnation and an excessive hardness towards oneself. On the physical level, possible symptoms include recurring inflammation of the throat and mouth or hyper- or hypothyroidism.\nElement Ether The throat chakra is dominated by the etheric element, which provides insights into the wondrous and mystical. Ether is considered the most subtle of all elements (besides earth, water, fire and air). Ether is regarded to be a state of time and space that allows a thing to exist. Thus this element is the very beginning of the manifestation process.\nMain features of the heart chakra  Sanskrit: Vissudha Position: Throat, neck Color: light blue Element: Ether Psychological function: Self-expression Challenge: Lying Creative identity \u0026ldquo;I talk.\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;I have the right to speak and be heard.\u0026rdquo;  Kundalini Yoga \u0026amp; Vissudha To activate this chakra or to bring it back into balance, the following yoga exercises from Kundalini Yoga can help you. 🧘🏽‍♂️\n Any chanting Shoulder stand Cobra Plow pose Camel position Cat - Cow Neck rolls Neck Lock Nose to the knees  As usual, these exercises are not a panacea and you have to look for yourself individually, what exactly you can do in which way. If you are uncertain, please always consult your doctor.\nDuring a Kundalini Yoga session usually different chakras are touched and activated, often with a focus.

The main attention in this chakra is on communication and self-expression.","tags":[],"title":"The fifth chakra","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"Having already got to know the first three chakras as the lower triangle, you will get some insights into the fourth chakra, the heart chakra, today. In Sanskrit it is called Anahata and can be translated as \u0026ldquo;not beaten sound\u0026rdquo;. It is a sound that is not produced externally, i.e. without the clash of two things. This alone brings a certain fascination and enables us to look beyond the horizon.\nThe heart chakra, as the name suggests, is located in the heart space in the middle of the chest on the sternum. The heart and the lungs are assigned to this chakra as organs, as well as the thymus gland. As far as the colors are concerned, we are now in the space of pink and green, where pink means the heart itself and green emphasizes more the protection of the heart. As a rule, however, only the color green is referred to. 💚\nThe heart chakra is located exactly in the middle of the first seven chakras and connects the lower triangle (first 3 chakras) to the upper triangle ( 5th to 7th chakra). Thus it connects the worldly dimension (lower triangle), our humanity, with the spiritual level (upper triangle), our soul. It provides a balance between the lower energy flow of the earth and the flow of the upper energies of heaven and prepares the way from the I to the WE. The heart chakra, as the first chakra, becomes completely subtle. The main focus within this chakra is on love, awakening, trust, devotion, pain and forgiveness. 🙏🏽\nLove, love, love The Anahata has enormous power and significance. It processes the experiences of love as well as the subtle feelings and sensations associated with love. The energy of the heart chakra develops your capacity for unconditional love and devotion. In the heart dwells the pure, universal love of your soul. This brings with it the ability to accept all people and events with a non-judgmental acceptance, i.e. with neutrality. Through the love that then permeates you, you can feel and learn your own inner truth without condemnation. A space is opened to you in which you can feel everything. No pain or darkness can damage this strong unconditional love.\nHere the complex world of human love opens up and relationships of real love become possible. This is where you are prepared for deeper love, the spiritual love of the soul and cosmic love. The search for love in the outside then ideally leads to finding love within yourself as a source. By embodying love, because it is within you, you also give it to the outside, so that your light of love can be reflected and fulfilled in the world. With this experience you can let yourself fall even more into yourself, open yourself to the inside, because you do not (any longer) need the outside for feeling love. You can always get in contact with love, because it always flows. This love finally also enables you to forgive from the heart. ❤️\nAnother characteristic is the sensitivity that this chakra brings with it. Here you are touchable up to your soul and you can also feel other people with their true self. In addition, a universal consciousness of connectedness can arise in you, which goes beyond the realm of your personality. Your heart centre determines the subtle feeling and the ability to touch. When a person speaks from his/her heart, this touches us, as it penetrates to our innermost being.\nCentral is also the topic of healing and spiritual growth. Through the contact to your own soul you come closer to yourself and can stimulate a healing process. Personality and ego are then transcended.\nIn Kundalini Yoga by Yogi Bhajan the mind is divided into three different minds: negative, positive and neutral. What exactly this means, I will explain to you in a separate blog post. The heart chakra definitely also refers to the area of the neutral mind, as this is necessary to give other people the same value we would attribute to ourselves. Here in the fourth chakra there is a conflict-free state in which heaven and earth come together in balance. Inside and outside merge in a perception of flowing.\nThe already mentioned lower three chakras embody, among other things, the cultivation as well as mastery of the impulse, whereby the feeling of the ego is present. When your heart chakra opens, you reach the first true level of self-reflective consciousness. You can see yourself through the eyes of others and realize that other beings are as important as yourself. Thus the feeling of I shifts more to a feeling of WE. An important basis for this is a powerful, stable self (through a strong lower triangle) to open your heart chakra. If your lower triangle is still too weak or even disturbed, then the love of your heart can be pulled again and again into the dynamic of the needs of the lower three chakras and in the end be distorted.\nWhen your heart chakra is open there is a connection between your heart and your mind in the light of your soul. Your soul can then express itself in your personality. This is also called the gateway to other dimensions of being. People with an open heart chakra have recognized the source of love and love themselves unconditionally. In life they let themselves be guided by their sensations of the heart, which is also called heart intelligence. There is a devotional and expectation-free love as well as acceptance towards all living beings present, because a feeling for the soul is felt deep inside the others. Through this universal love from within, there is a radiance to the outside, which is also perceptible for the environment. 💓\nTrue joy of the heart and much laughter are present, as well as warmth, love, compassion, sensitivity, gentleness and patience are felt within oneself. A deep feeling of gratitude and connectedness with all that is is created. The relationship to the own feelings is renewed and they can be consciously recognized and controlled. Furthermore, people with an open Anahata give themselves as well as all others the freedom to grow independently and to accept any path in life.\nIn addition, the heart chakra can also be described as another immune system that knows when something is a foreign or belonging part. This means that you know how to include people appropriately in each of your relationships.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s also look at the area of communication: communication from the heart center includes others as well as yourself. You speak with empathy and kindness to yourself and others. You are aware of the person to whom your communication is directed. Thus a feeling of presence can be perceived by all participants. The language here is true, but always friendly.\nCan the heart chakra also be disturbed? Your heart chakra can also show blockages or disorders that can have various causes - like every other chakra. In general the experience and feeling of being separated from love can lead to a traumatic experience. Strong emotional pain can then trigger blockages in the Anahata. This in turn can lead to distrust and a refusal or even inability to love or be loved. Blockages can also be caused by feelings of resentment or revenge, which in turn have their own individual history. The connection to the own heart can also be interrupted if a person has done something to others, which can lead to a strain on the soul and finally to self rejection or condemnation. 💔\nGenerally speaking, one of the two poles of relationship is usually overemphasized: a narcissistic self-centredness and refusal to face the world or a self-sacrificing dependence on the love of others, even to the point of self-abandonment or even self-hate. Thus, overactivity of the heart chakra may lead to an excess of compassion. An undersupply, in turn, can end in dependence and a disturbed feeling for the own self.\nThe element air The element assigned to the Anahata is air. It is symbolized by the breath, which creates a connecting flow between you and creation - by the fact that the air surrounding you enters you and exits again as the breath of life, touching the world. Allow what is also hidden behind your breath to work on you\u0026hellip;\nCan I touch that? Here you can also find one of our senses, which is assigned to this chakra: the sense of touch. This means above all to feel, perceive, touch and be touched on various levels. Also the connection to the hands stands for the ability to touch and feel.\nMain features of the heart chakra  Sanskrit: Anahata Position: Heart centre, in the middle of the chest on the sternum Color: Green (and Pink) Element: Air Psychological function: self-acceptance Challenge: Grief Social identity \u0026ldquo;I love.\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;I have the right to love and be loved.\u0026rdquo;  Kundalini Yoga \u0026amp; Anahata What would we do without Kundalini Yoga, that\u0026rsquo;s what I sometimes think. It is such a powerful resource for us human beings here on earth that I am enthusiastic about this style of yoga and its possibilities every time. You can also find specific exercises that work on your heart chakra and can release blockages and connect to other chakras.\n Ego Eradicator Yoga Mudra Bear grip Baby Pose All arm exercises Exercises that rotate the upper part of the upper body All Pranayama exercises  Furthermore, the sound is also explicitly mentioned here. The sound \u0026ldquo;Ham\u0026rdquo; can open your heart chakra and activate the relationship with the fifth chakra. The Anahata is stimulated by Prana, so that the use of Pranayama (breathing techniques) stimulates your heart space in a powerful way.\nAgain, please look for yourself to see what works and what does not, where your individual possibilities and limits lie! This small list can serve as an aid, which you are welcome to try out if you feel like working on your fourth chakra.\nWithin a Kundalini Yoga session usually different chakras are touched and activated, often with a focus.

The Sanskrit name for this chakra is Manipura. Manipura translates as \u0026ldquo;city of jewels.\u0026quot;\nThe third chakra can be located in the area of the navel point to just above the solar plexus, also known as the \u0026ldquo;sun network\u0026rdquo;. On a physical level several organs are assigned to this chakra: liver, gall bladder, spleen, digestive organs, pancreas, adrenal glands and solar plexus. In terms of color, we are now at the color yellow. Together with the first and second chakra, the lower triangle is completed by the navel chakra. Central issues within this chakra are action as well as balance, thought patterns and beliefs, personality, power, willpower and control.\nMore specifically, the third chakra is the center of energy and willpower, which comes together with a sense of coordination and control. The basic energetic balance is massively influenced by the third chakra. The mentioned topics are linked to the self-conception you have as a human being and your personal power and strength. This is your driving force, which ultimately brings you into action - also to realize your own ideas. Ideally, the topic of power expresses itself through self-confidence, integrity and the ability to act. 💪🏽\nA central concept here is also personality. Within this chakra your experiences and complex emotions are digested and translated into a mental structure. This is also where the relationship to the digestive organs becomes visible. Your own mental concepts emerge, which in turn are fundamental for the processing of conscious and unconscious experiences. A mental structure of thoughts and beliefs is formed, which then develops into the self-perception of your own personality. Thus, in addition to all life experiences, your own identity or a collection of different identities is formed. Through the solar plexus chakra you can get access to these identities - in the form of fears and deep-seated unconscious thought and behavior patterns. Furthermore, your own personality is THE possibility to let the light of your soul radiate into the world. ✨\nThe third chakra is also identified as the gateway to the fourth chakra, where the space of the unconscious is left. This unconscious is concentrated in the entire lower triangle. The heart centre in the fourth chakra marks the starting point for the consciousness. In the solar plexus chakra the subconscious as well as the gut feeling is processed.\nNavel center \u0026amp; it\u0026rsquo;s power Let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at the navel centre, which can also be seen as a symbol for the beginning. The navel point is the first point through which a person is nourished, i.e. supplied with energy. After birth, this navel point, which still exists, serves to absorb cosmic energy.\nIt is also interesting to note the positive effect that the alternate movement of arms and legs has on our system, such as when we go for a walk. This is because energy is accumulated at the navel point, which is accordingly available to us. The third chakra therefore also houses the energy reserve of the body. In addition, from the navel point the Kundalini energy is set in motion and sent on its journey upwards. With this power we can penetrate into the higher levels of consciousness, which lie above the navel chakra. On this basis it also makes sense that it is important to stimulate, strengthen and finally distribute the energy at the navel point. This can be done, for example, through the Kundalini Yoga Asana \u0026ldquo;Stretching Pose\u0026rdquo;, which can be performed for a few minutes directly in the morning to stimulate the energy. It is also related to the feeling for the presence of sufficient energy to support your own actions. This energy can then be projected with willpower to encourage action.\nTotally in balance 💛 This third chakra also represents the need and the drive to realize your own ideas and wishes, to master challenges and to test yourself. It gives you strength for change, discipline and self-transformation - besides the need for control.\nWhen you have mastered the third chakra, you have gained the knowledge of how to initiate and end an action. You are able to recognize your own mission and create enough energy to act so that this mission can be accomplished. Furthermore, you are connected to your higher consciousness and use your fearlessness to act with integrity, regardless of the conditions.\nWith a well-functioning, open navel chakra, your own life as well as the quality of life is dependent on your own actions. Often you can find so-called \u0026ldquo;doers\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;action people\u0026rdquo; who are seldom calm, because they do a lot and are in action. Even weak intentions generate actions. The actions from this chakra are focused and characterized by tactical intelligence. Thus, goals can be achieved despite possible obstacles and emerging challenges do not become a barrier.\nIt is the ability to direct, shape and develop what happens in life, which ultimately leads to deep trust and a feeling of security. This can also explain why these people are often perceived by others as being at peace with themselves and having strong nerves. A dominance in the third chakra also ensures exuberance and expression. There is a relationship to your own feelings, which are also used to achieve your goals. The own feelings can be reflected in an enriching way and stressful situations can be approached in a concentrated and peaceful way. In addition, the ideas about your own abilities are very realistic and also your opinion is lived out in a healthy way. People take responsibility and cannot be manipulated. They have found their place in life and are about to fulfil their mission. They also possess a high degree of integrity and decision-making ability and can set themselves apart from the environment in a healthy way. Their own strengths and weaknesses are known by themselves. Their self-esteem is healthy and they have the ability for self-reflection and discipline. Basically you can meet here adult, mature personalities who have integrated their \u0026ldquo;inner child\u0026rdquo;.\nNot enough energy\u0026hellip; If there is too little energy in the navel chakra or if it is disturbed, this can have various effects on the individual life.\nThis feeling of lack of energy leads to a recourse to other energy sources (for example through drugs or food), through which new energy can be accumulated. It should be obvious that this kind of energy supply is rather of an unhealthy nature. An urge to compensate is also being exerted through this.\nAdditionally, although there are good ideas and intentions, they are not put into practice. This is due to the lack of energy, which prevents the action from taking place. Also the emotional-mental processing of experiences can be blocked, which leads to an overwhelming of experiences and feelings. This in turn leads to a suppression of emotional expressions with the attempt of control and rationalisation. Often an undersupply or disturbance of this chakra also leads to being overwhelmed by the challenges of life, desperation, anger, fear and weakness of will. The world is then perceived much more through a filter of powerlessness and worthlessness. This results in a pronounced emotional instability. A movement between the extremes of control mania on the one hand and letting oneself go on the other can be experienced. In addition, these people may see themselves more as victims and feel neglected, in dependencies, envious and embittered. The self-image is shaped by negative convictions and eventually leads to a loss of self-worth and in extreme cases even to self-hatred. This chakra can also become (over)active when another chakra is overloaded.\nThe element fire 🔥 This chakra is associated with the element fire. This symbolises the willingness to set things in motion. Very well known in Kundalini Yoga is the breath of fire, which supplies your third chakra with energy and also has a detoxifying function.\nCan you see it? The sense associated with the navel chakra is seeing. This power of seeing is linked to the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Vision is also about visualizing personal goals and creating concrete images. In this way a sense of focus and will can be created. It also stands for looking out into the world and then enables a comparison with the self-concept. Finally, vision then also creates a feeling of control. 👁️\nWhat I consider particularly exciting here is spiritual vision. It enables you to perceive the emotional-mental field that surrounds you and to feel the energies of the people around you in an intuitive way. Fascinating! 🌟\nMain characteristics of the navel chakra  Sanskrit: Manipura Position: Area of the navel center, solar plexus Color: Yellow Element: Water Psychological function: Self-definition Challenge: Shame Ego Identity \u0026ldquo;I do.\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;I have the right to act.\u0026rdquo;  Kundalini Yoga \u0026amp; Manipura Manipura can also be activated, balanced and reconnected to the other equally important chakras through certain asanas from Kundalini Yoga.

In Sanskrit this chakra is called Svadisthana, where sva stands for \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;prana\u0026rdquo; and adisthana for \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dwelling place\u0026rdquo;. Thus, in summary, the translation \u0026ldquo;dwelling place of the self\u0026rdquo; can be crystallized.\nThe sacral chakra is located in the region of the sexual organs, at the level of the hip bones under the navel. Relevant here are the reproductive glands (testicles, ovaries) as well as the kidneys and bladder. Orange is assigned to this second chakra as the color. Together with the first and third chakra it belongs to the lower triangle.\nThe main themes of this chakra are creativity, sexuality and reproduction, desire, sensuality as well as vitality and joy of life. Basically, sensual, sexual and emotional experiences are processed in this chakra.\nMore precisely this means that the sacral chakra is about the sensual experience of life and touching the world. The soul shows itself here with its desire for joyful interaction with life, for participation in the creative play of life energy. In the experimential space of this chakra, all pure forms in the areas of life force, joy of life and emotional self-expression can be experienced. The deep need for the flow of life energy and living out of our creative power, which is inherent in all of us, lies in the sacral chakra. It is therefore a matter of experiencing creative life energy. Creativity can be created, for example, through words and vibrations that you produce. This is possible, among other things, through sexuality, because through this we can express life energy as well as needs and experience and directly touch the world. Equally important is the experience of emotions, because these allow an intense and colourful exploration of the world and make your experience as a human being in this world real for the soul.\nThe sexual contact with another person is a first experience of merging and going beyond your own self, as it comes to dissolving with and into each other. During the sexual release a state of forgetting yourself arises for a short moment, which allows you to experience bliss by letting go and merging. Finity and infinity connect in this moment of physical love and create a feeling of creative consciousness. Sexuality can thus finally be used to experience the spirit. The act itself is an opportunity to live out creativity.\nThe power of emotions is also an important aspect. In fact, our feelings are connected to our thoughts, so thinking is not a non-emotional activity. The thoughts that you have evoke different emotions and the feelings in turn control the intensity, current and credibility of your thoughts.\nThe element water The sacral chakra is associated with the element water and the organs that regulate the water balance in the body. It is about the flow of life energy, vitality and general health through an active second chakra. Just as water moves freely, flows and has no predetermined form, so it is with feelings. These can give form to our habits. Water has the corresponding ability to shape the earth through constant influence, and it is much more flexible than the element earth (belonging to the root chakra).\nIf the second chakra works well, you live in passion, motivation and with independent opinions. The language is often characterized by sensuality, colorfulness and target orientation as well as being flexible and fluent. This is reminiscent of the above mentioned properties of water. 💦\nPeople with a distinct, open second chakra see the world in terms of feelings and desires, as a place to fulfill passions. There is a passionate relationship to the liveliness itself, so that these people like to feel their liveliness. They devote themselves fully to the experience of life, live in the moment, feel joy and passion, accept their own emotions with confidence and live them out. They also like to let their sexual energy flow with devotion, enjoy it and have a sexual life marked by lust. Furthermore, they rarely feel guilt or shame and live in harmony with their true physical and emotional needs, which they pursue with a healthy matter of course. Self-acceptance and self-love are often well developed on this basis and inner balance is present. 🧡\nThat\u0026rsquo;s tasty! The sense associated with this chakra is taste. It is interesting to note that the taste in your mouth changes when you experience great passion. When you practice yoga, for example, you enter into a connection with the infinite, which can trigger the production of the sweet nectar Amrit and finally a change in taste.\nOut of balance \u0026hellip; However, the sacral chakra - just like any other chakra - can be blocked or disrupted and thus cause manifestations that can make living and acting difficult. This can happen, for example, when a person simply lacks sensual, sexual and emotional experiences or when overwhelming and therefore too intense experiences have been made in this area. Both extremes - undersupply as well as oversupply - lead to an imbalance or blockage. The consequences are visible through many characteristics, for example in frozen emotions, feelings of guilt, boundless action and a lack of responsibility in relationships. In addition, a reduced flow of life energy is often reported and an associated reduced joy of life, including chronic fatigue and listlessness. Due to a low level of passion, the own opinion is not very pronounced. Signs of a dysfunctional sacral chakra can also be seen in the acting out of sexuality. On the one hand there can be an increased loss of libido, i.e. a reduced desire for sexual interactions, and on the other hand there can be an excessive desire for sex, which is more likely to be described as sexual addiction or sexual mania.\nIn general, problems in dealing with the own emotions as well as those of the fellow human beings occur here. On a physical level, there can be problems with the kidneys and reproductive organs. Potency problems, urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases can also arise.\nMain characteristics of the sacral/sexual chakra  Sanskrit: Svadisthana Position: Genitals, one hand-width below the navel Color: Orange Element: Water Psychological function: Self-reward Challenge: Guilt Emotional identity \u0026ldquo;I feel.\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;I have the right to feel, to want.\u0026rdquo;  Kundalini Yoga \u0026amp; Svadisthana As already mentioned in the first article about the chakras, the practice of Kundalini Yoga can help you to activate energies within your body and therefore also your chakras, to open and balance them. 🧘🏽‍♂️ It is important to remind yourself that the exercises can create a balance and establish a relationship with the energies of the other chakras. With this a full functionality of the chakras can be (re)gained.\nHere is a list of exercises from Kundalini Yoga that can help you to work on your sacral chakra:\n Frogs Cobra Butterfly Sat Kriya Cat - Cow Maha Mudra Pelvic lifting  In general I would like to point out again that this list is not a \u0026ldquo;universal remedy\u0026rdquo; and you have to look for yourself what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, where the individual possibilities and limits are! It can serve as a help, which you are welcome to try out if you feel like working on your second chakra.\nWithin a Kundalini Yoga session usually different chakras are touched and activated, often with a special focus. If you would like to know more about this or if you would like to book a Kundalini Yoga session with me on a specific chakra or topic, feel free to send me an email. ✉️\nIn my next blog post I will explain more about the third chakra - to keep up to date with my current posts, I invite you to follow me on my social media channels ( facebook, twitter, instagram). 🙏🏽\n","date":1593043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593043200,"objectID":"e9a2010c8786465bcf1b4c2c687b2745","permalink":"https://ruhahealing.com/post/the-second-chakra/","publishdate":"2020-06-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-second-chakra/","section":"post","summary":"Get to know the specific power of the second chakra \"Svadisthana\", where we focus on creativity, sexuality and emotions.","tags":[],"title":"The second chakra","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":"Perhaps you have already heard that the human body is equipped with different chakras. In Kundalini Yoga we always refer to the chakras and their particular energies, which can be stimulated by the postures. But let me start from the beginning.\nWhat exactly is a chakra? The word \u0026ldquo;chakra\u0026rdquo; comes from Sanskrit and means wheel or circle. It refers to energy wheels or centres in the body that are in a constant circular motion. According to this, a certain energy and power emanates from them. This energy flow refers to an interplay between physical and subtle space. These energy wheels are always in motion and change, just as the energy itself constantly changes its frequency of oscillation.\nIn the context of Kundalini Yoga the focus is on 8 chakras. Seven of these chakras are related to the endocrine system or nerve plexuses, the eighth is associated with the magnetic field of the body.\nThe chakras are activated by Prana, the power of life, and dissolve blockages that stand in the way of a free flow of energy, or first (re-) establish a connection. The goal is always that everything is in the flow, that the energy centres can let their energies flow out. Through Kundalini Yoga this flow and the necessary balance and purification of the chakras can be made possible. If there are blockages in the chakras, these can be released by practicing yoga. 🧘🏽‍♂️\nIt is also interesting to note that the chakras influence perception as well as decisions and feelings, as they can be related to different parts of the body. Furthermore, they influence your own projection into the world. This again increases the power that emanates from them. Thus the flow of thoughts and energies in your system is also controlled by them. The human being therefore always acts and projects from the energies of the chakras.\nA closer inspection of the first chakra The chakra mentioned as the first in the series is the root chakra. In Sanskrit it is called Muladhara, where mula means \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo; and adhara means \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo;. The root chakra is located at the end of the spine between the anus and the sexual organ. The first chakra is associated with the colour red - see the red dot at the bottom of the figure above. It belongs together with the second and third chakra to the lower triangle. It is also referred to as the foundation and serves for survival, gives security and stands for habits as well as self-acceptance. ❤️\nMore precisely, this means that the first chakra reduces everything to the basics and takes care of the basic needs. There is a connection to the element earth and therefore it is responsible for all manifestations in the physical nature. The root chakra also serves to automate behaviour. Consequently, this is also the place for habits and contains the strength to develop regulated habits.\nThe root chakra is assigned to the area of excretion, the anus and the large intestine. Excretion here means everything from physical to emotional and mental. In order to survive, the human being needs a functioning ability to excrete, which is provided by the energy of this chakra. So there is a considerable protective factor connected with the first chakra. With this knowledge you can make yourself aware that you have the ability to release negative influences (e.g. people, thoughts, environments and more) with the help of the power of the first chakra.\nIt is quite exciting to realize the fact that the own emotions are connected to the energies in the chakras and are influenced by them. Depending on the intensity of the connection to the chakra, the different forms of emotions can be felt within yourself.\nIf the root chakra works well, you are connected to it and it is in harmony with the other chakras, then it gives purity, security, perseverance, versatility and other abilities such as steadfastness, loyalty, calmness, patience and a positive kind of intransigence. In addition, there is a feeling of self-sufficiency which arises from a restrained negative mind. No dangers are seen and the feeling of having a foundation and of experiencing and giving support is present. Based on this, changes are implemented step by step and a basic level of trust is a matter of course. Thus, the first chakra is also a basis for allowing the self-confidence to take root and grow. 🌱\nAt the same time it can also lead to an over- or dysfunction of the muladhara, which can result in various diseases. It is about letting go on the one hand and holding on the other. Not being able to let go of anything can mean, for example, that toxins multiply in your body and you poison yourself. Similarly, too much clinging to things such as habits and the resulting lack of new impulses can cause you to become emotionally undersupplied. This is based on a feeling of fear, for example of separation or poverty. More precisely, this means that there is a detachment from the inner grounding energy, i.e. a missing connection to the own root chakra. A balance or reconnection is accordingly important.\nAnother connection exists with the sense of smell. If you tend to hold on to and retain the toxins, you start to stink. Consequently, distance is experienced starting from other people. If the first chakra is in harmony, then you are more likely to spray a sweet body odor. What is certainly known to many is the statement that you have to be able to \u0026ldquo;smell each other\u0026rdquo;. The sense of smell also helps you to recognize or establish a similarity and connection to your counterpart through smell.\nMain characteristics of the root chakra  Sanskrit: Muladhara Position: at the end of the spine between anus and genitals Color: red Element: Earth Psychological function: Self-protection, Survival Challenge: Fear Physical identity \u0026ldquo;I am.\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;I have the right to exist.\u0026rdquo;  Kundalini Yoga \u0026amp; Muladhara Through the practice of Kundalini Yoga every energy of the chakras can be transformed and consciousness can be raised. You can use the techniques of Kundalini Yoga to use the system of the chakras for yourself. Through the practice of Kundalini Yoga you can build a strong(er) connection with this energy center - and all the other chakras as well. This can help you to arrive completely in your body and on earth, to live and to be in physical and emotional balance.\nMany of the techniques strengthen the central functions of the root chakra and integrate their energy into the higher chakras. In addition, imbalances within the chakras can be balanced and you can get back into your center. Often it is also said that there are blockades in one or more chakras, which you can dissolve with the help of different positions as well as Kriyas or meditations from Kundalini Yoga. In other words, you may also have a missing connection to your chakra, which you can find and restore through Kundalini Yoga. This is primarily about the connection to Mother Earth, to the basis of everything. 🌍\nHere you will find a list of positions that can harmonize and strengthen the first chakra:\n Crow position Chair position Body drops Frog position Mulbandh Forward bending Kick your bottom with your feet lying on your stomach  However, in general I would like to point out again that this list is not a \u0026ldquo;universal remedy\u0026rdquo; and everyone has to look for him or herself what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, where the individual possibilities and limits are! It can serve as an aid that you are welcome to try if you feel like working on your first chakra.\nWithin a Kundalini Yoga session, different chakras are usually touched and activated, whereby often a main focus can be identified.

I still liked this mixture of fresh fruits very much. Nevertheless I can say that I was looking forward to the growing variety in the coming days.\nAfter my work in the morning I started to cook again. For the last day this steamed vegetables were on the menu: broccoli, zucchini and leek. This was once again a very tasty combination and I ate a big portion of it.\nAs expected, this lunch didn\u0026rsquo;t keep me full for too long, so I prepared another green smoothie in the afternoon. This one was very tasty again and made of cress, half a banana, lemon, grapes, apple and rosemary. This preparation of smoothies in general is something that I would like to include more in my daily diet. They are quick to prepare, very healthy and can be customized. Definitely a recommendation! 👌🏽\n     💚\nFor dinner I fried the last green asparagus with onion and garlic. I also had the rest of today\u0026rsquo;s smoothie. All together the dinner was a really delicious meal. Peacefully I enjoyed everything in the evening sun and felt a lot of happiness and well-being inside me. With this feeling finally the seventh and for this time last day of my green diet passed.\nA few final thoughts\u0026hellip; Wow, I was really amazed at how quickly these 7 days went by. From the first day after the green diet I returned to eating non-green food. I was looking forward to eat other things again - variety is just fun and I love to cook and spontaneously throw things together. I also did this \u0026ldquo;throwing together\u0026rdquo; during the green diet and found it very exciting with green food as well. I can imagine myself doing this diet form for a few more days next time, because I still have some other recipe ideas and ingredients in my mind that would like to be realized.\nAfter a few days of the changeover I got really well used to this diet form and felt very energetic. I think it is a nice way to eat consciously and healthily. My body definitely felt lighter and more comfortable. I haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced the usual feeling of fullness once, because the food is simply much lighter during the green diet. Everything was very easy to digest for me and I generally perceived my digestion as very positive. Moreover, I did my own yoga set every morning and also practiced Kundalini Yoga sets on several evenings. This yoga supported me very well and additionally energized me and provided me with prana, i.e. life energy. A combination of the green diet and Kundalini Yoga is therefore also something I can warmly recommend.\nThe breakfast on the \u0026ldquo;day after\u0026rdquo; was more colourful again. There were green fruits, strawberries and oranges as well as oatmeal - all together as a colorful mix. Delicious! 😍\nFurthermore, I can say that my \u0026ldquo;relationship\u0026rdquo; to the color GREEN has intensified to a certain extent. Green can be found in so many things and is omnipresent. The power of this color is really tangible, the energy of green has definitely strengthened me.\nMaybe you would like to experience a green diet too!? You are more than welcome to write to me if you have further questions on this topic or if you would like to exchange ideas. 🙃\nWell, by the way: What does my dear dietary friend actually think about this whole thing? \u0026ldquo;When I first heard about this diet, I was very interested in trying this type of diet. Elvira asked me if I would like to join her and experience it at the same time. I read an article about it, in which they suggested to do the diet for 40 days \u0026hellip; 🤪 To be honest, I was a little worried if I could do it, but Elvira and I decided to try it for one week the first time.\nOn the first day I was really excited to see how my body and of course my mind would accept this challenge. I must say that it was really nice to have this experience, but after four days I started to miss more \u0026ldquo;colours\u0026rdquo; in my food.\nThe hardest fight for me was not using salt. I stopped drinking coffee two days before the diet. This was helpful to get used to the new way of eating and drinking.\nI think I\u0026rsquo;ll do the diet again, maybe like a little ritual four times a year. By the way, I lost some weight, but half of it came back after I returned to my normal eating habit. But losing weight was not my main goal either.\u0026rdquo;\nThanks for sharing this experience with me, dear friend! 🙏🏽\nI hope you can gain some inspiration and courage from our experiences to try out such a diet and just have a new experience for you \u0026amp; with you. Have fun with it! ✨\nImportant note: On my blog you can find tips and insights on the topics nutrition, health, body, mind and soul.

I know this from myself, so I took it easy and went peacefully to my yoga mat. Once there, I started with my Kundalini Yoga morning exercises, whereby I already noticed that I became quite warm, or rather hot. I then changed to short, airy clothes and continued with yoga, but left out some positions that require more power. I was sweating more and more, but not sweating due to the effort, but rather out of nowhere. I also had the feeling that I urgently needed food and water. So I first drank half a liter of water and started to prepare my breakfast and cut fruit. It is still the same as the days before. 😉 Afterwards I felt much better again and I think that this what happend to me in the morning was kind of a detoxification process. Wow - that was definitely very intense!\nAfter that I had enough energy to participate in my Sunday morning yoga class. I also felt very well there and was able to gain a lot of strength and prana, the so-called life energy, from it. I felt deep gratitude and bliss within me. 🙏🏽\nAfter the by now rather unspectacular, but always delicious breakfast, I made myself the really last leftovers of the mung bean dish for lunch. You already know this one from the past days. It was only a small remainder, but for now it satiated me sufficiently.\nAfterwards I cycled to the beach. Once there, the prepared snacks were taken out. For me these are grapes and melon. With sunshine and the sound of the sea these fresh snacks taste much better than they already do. ☀️ 🌊\nBack again from the bike trip I looked deeper into the fridge at home. There I actually found another mini leftover of the mung beans and ate it directly. Afterwards I ate some green olives and was satisfied again.\nIn the evening I offered my online Kundalini Yoga session. It was a lot of fun again and I felt really positively energized and very happy at the end of it. If you would like to participate in one of my online Kundalini Yoga classes, please register for it using the link at the end of this post. The course on every Sunday evening is so far free of charge and open for all interested people. I am looking forward to welcome you there! 🧘🏽‍♂️\n Day 6  After my breakfast, which you probably know by now, I did my work like every day. I still felt the positive after-effects of yesterday\u0026rsquo;s yoga session and all the healthy green food. My body has probably never received so much chlorophyll in such a short time. 🙃 I noticed a real energy boost and was looking forward to the recurring fruit breakfast more than usual.\nNevertheless, I was very hungry again around noon. While I was cutting the vegetables, my stomach felt very unfamiliar. It was definitely not just the hunger and rather felt a little crampy in my stomach. I had the feeling that my body was actively working and freeing me from toxins and other things like that. Even if it was a bit unpleasant, I could accept it. After a few minutes this process was over again and I prepared the following lunch for myself later: brussels sprouts, zucchini and green lentils with some onion and garlic - all steamed together. I was really happy to finally cook brussels sprouts again, which I really love to eat.\nIn the afternoon I started the smoothie production again. This time I used a little less of the cress as an ingredient, plus half a banana, a green apple, a kiwi and some of the green melon. This smoothie was definitely sweeter than last time and therefore even more delicious. I added a few ice cubes as refreshment and enjoyed the smoothie very much.\nI warmed up the leftovers from lunch again for the evening and sat down for dinner in the warming evening sun. This sixth day of the green diet was again very beneficial and enriching for my body.I felt strengthened and satisfied. The green diet is becoming easier and easier for me and I can very well imagine to follow this diet for a longer period next time. 💚\nImportant note: On my blog you can find tips and insights on the topics nutrition, health, body, mind and soul.

Thoughts of breakfast were already on my mind. I noticed that I was very much in the mood for my \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; breakfast, although it is somewhat similar to that - well, without any carbohydrates and another fruit variety. However, when I was about to eat my fresh fruit, I was happy and full again. Today I added some lemon on top. That gave my breakfast a special sour taste, which I really enjoyed.\nFor early lunch I had mung beans with green lentils, served with savoy cabbage, leek and broccoli. During these green diet days I find mung beans really tasty, maybe because they satiate me a bit more in comparison! In any case, this is a personal discovery of a food that I would like to use more regularly in cooking from now on. I\u0026rsquo;ve never used mung beans to prepare anything myself, I\u0026rsquo;ve only eaten them with others. Try it out! 🙃\nApart from that, I can say on this third day that I still felt very well, despite the regular hunger. However, I think this is understandable without all the carbohydrates that are usually integrated in my meals.\nFor an early dinner I made myself a green smoothie today. I can warmly recommend that as well! I had a mixture of a special kind of cress, an apple, a kiwi, half a banana WITH peel - yes that\u0026rsquo;s allowed 😉 - and half a lime in addition.\n     💚\nThis smoothie was really tasty, but a bit too bitter for me. Next time I\u0026rsquo;ll use some more sweet fruits.\nYou may have noticed that I always leave the skin on the kiwi. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for years. For me it tastes even more intense with the skin and remains a very tasty fruit in my opinion. This also applies to the less popular, hairy kiwis. 😉 Many of the nutrients are in or directly under the shell and by removing them your body will not even be able to enjoy these valuable ingredients. Consider this as an invitation to try one or the other fruit WITH the shell and do your body even more favours.\n Day 4  Today is \u0026ldquo;half time\u0026rdquo; - half of the green diet week is already mastered, so to speak, at least around noon.\nFor breakfast, I guess I don\u0026rsquo;t need to say much anymore: I ate the same fresh fruit as the last days. Also today I found this again a delicious and good mixture.\nIn fact, today I was not as hungry as the days before. It is often said that the body has to get used to this change during the first 1-3 days. So maybe I had truly arrived at all levels since today\u0026hellip;\nWhat I have noticed from time to time, however, are certain movements in the stomach area that seemed new to me. It felt a bit like internal cramps, but it was not really painful. I suspect detoxification processes in my body\u0026hellip; and with this thought I can accept the feeling well and let my body do its work.\nThen at lunch I just warmed up the leftovers from yesterday. It was the mung beans with lentils, broccoli, leeks and savoy cabbage. Even today this set still tasted wonderful. But that could also be because I took this food with me on our bike trip and then enjoyed it on the picnic blanket on the beach. This way everything tastes even better, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?! ☀️\nIn the evening I found myself back in the kitchen, preparing some tasty dinner for my fourth\u0026rsquo; day. This was fresh green asparagus, the remaining Pimientos de Padron and some zucchini. Everything was first steamed and at the end fried a little bit - delicious! Ready cooked I enjoyed the food outside in the evening sun.\nI really felt more and more comfortable with this form of nutrition. I had a lot of energy in me and was more than happy about this decision. Thus I was looking forward to the 3 further days ahead. I will also tell you about those in my upcoming blog articles.\nImportant note: On my blog you can find tips and insights on the topics nutrition, health, body, mind and soul.

Take a look at what I have on the menu these days and how my process continues.","tags":[],"title":"Green diet - Day 3 \u0026 4","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elvira"],"categories":[],"content":" Day 1  I usually eat a lot of fresh fruit in the morning, but I generally mix it with yoghurt or porridge. But today, my first breakfast allowed me only a pure green fruit bowl. These fruits did not really keep me full for a long time, so that I soon started to think about lunch. I bought some spinach, because I was very much in the mood for it. I added zucchini and a mini onion as well as some garlic (yes, these ingredients are allowed despite the missing green colour - what a blessing! 🙏🏽 ). Everything was cooked together and what can I say, it was really delicious. However, I forgot how much the leaves still lose volume during cooking. Thus the lunch portion was quite small for my big hunger.\nWell then, since there is no limit to the number of meals - luckily 😀 -, I started cooking again in the afternoon. I had previously soaked the mung beans for a few hours and then boiled them up. I also added a good amount of green lentils. I think lentils are just delicious and suitable for mung beans - from my point of view only recommendable. You can also add the lentils to the mung beans for the last 15 minutes if you want to eat them together anyway. Just make sure that you have enough water in your pot - mung beans and lentils need to have enough water to get ready. I also added zucchini, which were fried with some onion and garlic. That is another very tasty menu.\nIn the evening I did some Kundalini Yoga, which felt very good for me at this moment. I could immerse myself in the Kriya and relax. My body felt fulfilled and comfortable afterwards and I was deeply grateful.\nBut… maybe you can guess… I was hungry again that evening. Oh gosh, should I cook again? A view into the pantry makes my eyes stop at the Pimientos de Padron. So I fried some of them thoroughly. This was really tasty. I also ate a few green olives. Finally I felt filled up again.\nLater in the evening I went to bed with a little hunger, but also with a light and happy feeling. The food during the day did me very well, I already noticed that this evening.\n Day 2  The morning began as usual and I prepared my green fruit breakfast. It was the same as yesterday, a big bowl full of delicious fresh fruit. Yammi! 🍏🍐🥝🍈\nHowever, for today it was also clear that I had to buy more green food. Most of it was already consumed, so I planed to visit the local organic farm in the neighboring village in the afternoon. I also decided to go to the food market and buy some green stuff for today\u0026rsquo;s lunch. No sooner said than done. The market supplied me with leek, broccoli, green asparagus, savoy cabbage and cucumber. I also used some of these for my lunch menu. This was mung beans with green lentils, broccoli, leek and savoy cabbage.\nIn the afternoon I visited the mentioned local organic farm in Portugal. This is really beautifully situated in the hinterland, surrounded by a lot of green and fertile soil. With a friend who knows the owner of the farm, we cycled there together. I picked out some of the delicacies of this week\u0026rsquo;s harvest. Take a look! 👇🏽\nIn the big glass there are green olives from this region and in the smaller homemade ghee. Yes, this is also allowed as a small side addition in the dishes.\nAfterwards I was already looking forward to cook with all these fresh ingredients. For tonight\u0026rsquo;s dinner I prepared a delicious salad, as you can see on the next picture. As ingredients from the farm, you can find salad, raw zucchini and some of the fresh rosemary. I also added iceberg lettuce, which I had left over, as well as cucumber and dried garden herbs.\nIn addition I ate some of the olives. I mixed them with the herbs I got separately and that was a really delicious combination. I ate it all outside in the evening sun. The day ended really nice and I felt very well.\nAll in all I can say about these first two days that I definitely enjoyed them a lot. It is of course a change for the body, I felt that. Nevertheless, I also noticed that the green diet was good for me. I felt pleasantly satiated and even though I ate more food than usual, I felt lighter inside than usual. I was very curious how the next days would work out.

Among a variety of fasting cures and diets, I came across the so-called \u0026ldquo;Green Diet\u0026rdquo; in connection with Kundalini Yoga by Yogi Bhajan. The name immediately caught my attention and I wanted to learn more about it and experience it. The green diet uses the effect of the green substance chlorophyll, which can be found in any green food. During the green diet you eat mainly green fruits and vegetables and drink a lot of water or tea. This type of diet is vegan and is not limited in the amount of food you eat.\nGreen furthermore symbolizes growth, fertility and renewal. Many of you are certainly aware that green is also the color for calmness and harmony. The associations with the color green are usually positive. Green fruits, vegetables and other green foods are also beneficial to your whole organism as you can read next.\nEffects The green diet is alkaline and thus works on your acid-base balance with a focus on the alkaline. In doing so, you deacidify your body and start a detoxification process in your liver, which eventually rebuilds your whole organism. In addition, your skin is cleaned and toxic mucus is removed from your liver - so it is cleaned as well. Weight loss can also be a side effect, but this is not the main focus. This and even more happens mainly due to the ingredient ✨CHLOROPHYLL.✨\nGreen food contains chlorophyll to varying degrees. This can have a health-promoting effect on your body due to the amount absorbed. This strengthens your immune system and your defences. Chlorophyll is also an antioxidant and protects your body from free radicals. Your magnesium and iron balance is improved and your blood cells are purified and new blood cells are formed. Chlorophyll is also known as a natural anti-aging agent.\nAll in all, your whole body experiences an activation on a physical and mental level and can only benefit from it.\nWhat to eat? The possibilities here are definitely sufficient and it is also an interesting focus to concentrate only on green food. It is a pleasure to walk through the supermarket with this attention and be surprised by the green variety. I\u0026rsquo;ll list some food groups with examples here, which should be broadly available:\n any green salads and leafy vegetables (e.g. rocket, lamb\u0026rsquo;s lettuce, chicory, spinach, chard, pakchoi) 🥬 sprouts and germs (e.g. mung beans, green lentils) green vegetables (e.g. asparagus, okras, zucchini, broccoli, peas, green beans, spring onions, green peppers, leek, fennel and many more) 🥦 green fruits (e.g. limes, from the inside green melons, pears, apples, kiwis, grapes, cucumber, olives, avocado) 🥑 Oils (e.g. olive oil, pumpkin seed oil, ghee) Herbs (e.g. nettle, wild garlic, dandelion, peppermint, lemon balm, parsley, coriander and many more) 🌿 spices (e.g. green pepper, wasabi, dried green spices) Superfoods like wheatgrass, nettle powder, spirulina, chlorella and hemp protein  🚫 Important: No salt!\nAnd what about drinking? Water and herbal teas (also green tea) are the most important things. But also green juices and the well-known green smoothies are allowed and a satisfying snack between meals. These are best prepared fresh. In fact, you can also drink the cooked or steamed water from your vegetables. Nothing has to be poured away. 😉 However, there are also drinks that you should not consume: coffee, alcohol and black tea. It makes sense to wean yourself off these drinks before you start your green diet, if you drink them at all.\nWell, so much for the theory of this detoxifying, purifying diet form. I have decided to do the green diet for 7 days. Together with a friend of mine I plan to eat only green for the next seven days. Exciting!\nI will share the process and several of my meals on my blog with you in the coming days. Be curious and let yourself be inspired. 💫\nImportant note: On my blog you can find tips and insights on the topics nutrition, health, body, mind and soul.

Each Yoga form has its own fascination. I myself feel most attracted by Kundalini Yoga, although I did a lot of Hatha Yoga for years. Nevertheless, Kundalini Yoga has a certain attraction that I have never encountered before in yoga.\nYoga in general The power of yoga is generally very high and the effects of regular practice are very beneficial to your entire body-mind-soul system. With your own yoga practice you create a connection and go into relation with yourself. A central word here is \u0026ldquo;consciousness\u0026rdquo;. With the techniques of yoga you receive practical tools to connect with your higher and finally with the universal consciousness. You can explore your own dimensions, depth and possibilities as a human being.\nBut why Kundalini Yoga? Because it is an incredibly energetic collection of possibilities to increase your consciousness and to work on your very individual energy flow. You are infused with different kinds of energies and can master them with Kundalini Yoga. With the flow of energy it is quite simple: The energy is in you in one way or another anyway! But with the help of Kundalini Yoga you can feel, control and finally use the energy for yourself. This is just amazing! 🤩\nThe various exercises work on your glandular and nervous system and strengthen it through regular practice. A strong nervous system is always and maybe especially now in the current time full of challenges an important basis. By working on your nervous system you also strengthen yourself for your life outside of yoga and that is a really valuable asset.\nIn my opinion, the special charm is also based on the fact that many of the exercises in Kundalini Yoga are quite special. I have never experienced many of the positions and postures in other yoga forms and can say that they touch me extraordinarily intensely. During the exercises you can often feel where inner activity is developing, where the energy is flowing, where it is blocked and more. In addition, you meet yourself again and again, especially when you completely devote yourself to the exercises. It is not uncommon for students to report special feelings and sensations after the yoga sessions. That alone has something magic for me! ✨ This also happens through the work on your 8 chakras. The theory and meaning of the chakra knowledge is just as valuable and helpful for your own spiritual path. You\u0026rsquo;ll find blog posts with an introduction to the world of each chakra later on my website. Interested in these and other issues? You are welcome to stay up to date and follow me on social media to be informed about new blog posts.\nAll in all, Kundalini Yoga gives you power and inspiration for your development and can result in awakening your soul. This process is also called the awakening of the Kundalini energy. 💫\nThe term \u0026ldquo;Kundalini\u0026rdquo; The word Kundalini is referred to as the awakening of your soul. It is often mentioned that through yoga you can awaken your kundalini energy and let it rise into your higher chakras. According to yogic understanding, this specific energy lies curled up in the lowest chakra, the muladhara, and can be made to rise through yogic practice. Then, through specific exercises, this powerful energy is stimulated and enabled to flow through the chakras and finally reach the very top. Once there, it is said that you attain a state of \u0026ldquo;super-consciousness\u0026rdquo; in consciousness. ✨ WOW! ✨ Does\u0026rsquo;t that sound fascinating?\nPerhaps you already realized how powerful Kundalini Yoga is as a whole. However, theoretical insights into how it works are not the only thing that matters. Especially important is: Experience it! Get involved and meet your own energy system, put yourself in relation to your true identity, your Sat Nam.\nI invite you to be part in my online Kundalini Yoga sessions. Once a week, usually Sunday evening 6pm CEST, I give Kundalini Yoga online live classes for free. I am happy to meet you there. Feel free to sign up for it here:\nLoading… What does such a class look like? We will all - as a group and at the same time each one of us for him or herself - tune in with the Adi Mantra \u0026ldquo;Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo\u0026rdquo;. This prepares your system and connects you to your higher self. Followed by the protection mantra \u0026ldquo;Ad Gureh Nameh\u0026rdquo;, we create an almost sacred space. Then we start with the movement and your body can WARM UP with a few exercises.\nEqually important is the handling of the breath. This is an indispensable connection to every life and therefore very important. Through different PRANAYAMA techniques, i.e. breathing techniques, different energy states can be created and controlled. There is a wide range of pranayama exercises with different rhythms and tempos, which then have their individual influence on the body-mind-soul system.\nCentral part of a Kundalini Yoga class is the KRIYA. The term Kriya stands for a series of exercises. The range for these Kriyas is all-encompassing and really huge. You can find everything from very gentle to medium to very challenging Kriyas. The difference to other yoga styles such as hatha yoga is that many exercises are dynamic. Often the position is also in connection with a certain breathing technique like for example the energizing fire breath. But there are also static postures, which are not really comparable with positions I know from other yoga styles. It\u0026rsquo;s a special yoga world which is worth getting to know.\nThrough this practice you prepare your body for the final meditation. When the Kriya is finished, you will have the opportunity for DEEP RELAXATION before MEDITATION. This will help your body to integrate all the experiences made in the series of exercises on a cellular level. For meditation, the possibilities are equally wide and varied. Basically it is common to distinguish between meditations with and without mantra. At the very end we tune out with the song \u0026ldquo;May the long time\u0026rdquo; and simply enjoy the flow of energy in our system. 🙏\nAs you can see, in Kundalini Yoga we like to chant mantras. You can open your heart and connect with the sound-flow of the mantras. If you really get involved and let the songs enter your system, you can dive deeply into yourself and feel a sense of well-being.\n“Yoga is not going to make you great.
