<p>For breakfast today I had the same for the last time as the previous six days. I still liked this mixture of fresh fruits very much. Nevertheless I can say that I was looking forward to the growing variety in the coming days.</p>
<p>After my work in the morning I started to cook again. For the last day this steamed vegetables were on the menu: <strong>broccoli, zucchini and leek</strong>. This was once again a very tasty combination and I ate a big portion of it.</p>
<p><img src="lunch_day7.jpg" alt="Lunch"></p>
<p>As expected, this lunch didn&rsquo;t keep me full for too long, so I prepared another <strong>green smoothie</strong> in the afternoon. This one was very tasty again and made of cress, half a banana, lemon, grapes, apple and rosemary. This preparation of smoothies in general is something that I would like to include more in my daily diet. They are quick to prepare, very healthy and can be customized. <strong>Definitely a recommendation!</strong> 👌🏽</p>

<p>For dinner I fried the last <strong>green asparagus with onion and garlic</strong>. I also had the rest of today&rsquo;s smoothie. All together the dinner was a really delicious meal. Peacefully I enjoyed everything in the evening sun and felt a lot of <strong>happiness and well-being</strong> inside me. With this feeling finally the seventh and for this time last day of my green diet passed.</p>
<p><img src="dinner_day7.jpg" alt="Dinner"></p>
<h3 id="a-few-final-thoughts">A few final thoughts&hellip;</h3>
<p>Wow, I was really amazed at how quickly these 7 days went by. From the first day after the green diet I returned to eating non-green food. I was looking forward to eat other things again - <strong>variety</strong> is just fun and I love to cook and spontaneously throw things together. I also did this &ldquo;throwing together&rdquo; during the green diet and found it very exciting with green food as well. I can imagine myself doing this diet form for a few more days next time, because I still have some <strong>other recipe ideas and ingredients</strong> in my mind that would like to be realized.</p>
<p>After a few days of the changeover I got really well used to this diet form and felt very <strong>energetic</strong>. I think it is a nice way to <strong>eat consciously and healthily</strong>. My body definitely felt <strong>lighter and more comfortable</strong>. I haven&rsquo;t experienced the usual feeling of fullness once, because the food is simply much lighter during the green diet. Everything was very <strong>easy to digest</strong> for me and I generally perceived my digestion as very positive.
Moreover, I did my own yoga set every morning and also practiced <strong>Kundalini Yoga</strong> sets on several evenings. This yoga <strong>supported me very well</strong> and additionally energized me and provided me with <strong>prana</strong>, i.e. life energy. A <strong>combination of the green diet and Kundalini Yoga</strong> is therefore also something I can warmly recommend.</p>
<p>The breakfast on the &ldquo;day after&rdquo; was more colourful again. There were green fruits, strawberries and oranges as well as oatmeal - all together as a colorful mix. Delicious! 😍</p>
<p><img src="breakfast_day_8.jpg" alt="Breakfast"></p>
<p>Furthermore, I can say that my &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; to the <strong>color GREEN</strong> has intensified to a certain extent. Green can be found in so many things and is omnipresent. The power of this color is really tangible, the energy of green has definitely <strong>strengthened me</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe you would like to experience a green diet too!? You are more than welcome to write to me if you have further questions on this topic or if you would like to exchange ideas. 🙃</p>
<h3 id="well-by-the-way-what-does-my-dear-dietary-friend-actually-think-about-this-whole-thing">Well, by the way: What does my dear dietary friend actually think about this whole thing?</h3>
<p>&ldquo;When I first heard about this diet, I was very interested in trying this type of diet. Elvira asked me if I would like to join her and experience it at the same time. I read an article about it, in which they suggested to do the diet for 40 days &hellip; 🤪
To be honest, I was a little worried if I could do it, but Elvira and I decided to try it for one week the first time.</p>
<p>On the first day I was really <strong>excited</strong> to see how my body and of course my mind would accept this challenge. I must say that it was really nice to have this experience, but after four days I started to miss more &ldquo;colours&rdquo; in my food.</p>
<p><strong>The hardest fight for me was not using salt.</strong> I stopped drinking coffee two days before the diet. This was helpful to get used to the new way of eating and drinking.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll do the diet again, maybe like a <strong>little ritual four times a year</strong>. By the way, I lost some weight, but half of it came back after I returned to my normal eating habit. But losing weight was not my main goal either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing this experience with me, dear friend! 🙏🏽</p>
<p>I hope you can gain some <strong>inspiration</strong> and <strong>courage</strong> from our experiences to try out such a diet and just have a new experience for you &amp; with you. Have fun with it! ✨</p>
