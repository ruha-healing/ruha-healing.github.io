  <div class="article-container">

    <div class="article-style">
      <p>Having already got to know the fifth chakra as the beginning of the upper triangle, you can now explore the sixth chakra, the brow chakra. In Sanskrit the brow chakra is known as <strong>&ldquo;Ajna&rdquo;</strong>, which translated means &ldquo;to command&rdquo;. Therefore the sixth chakra is also called the <strong>command chakra</strong>. Even better known is the name <strong>&ldquo;third eye&rdquo;</strong>, which is a very common term for many yogis &amp; yoginis.</p>
<p>The brow chakra is located, as can be assumed, in the area of the forehead <strong>between and slightly above the eyebrows</strong>. Organically, the <strong>brain</strong> and especially the <strong>pituitary gland (hypophysis)</strong> are assigned to this chakra.
In the spectrum of colors we are now in the range of <strong>indigo</strong> (dark purple). In addition, this chakra is often represented by <strong>light</strong> - as an assigned characteristic. Here the <strong>inner light</strong> is meant.
The elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether) are left with the third eye, which means we are now <strong>moving outside the five elements</strong> that can be related to the previous chakras.</p>
<p>The main focus of the third eye is on <strong>intuition</strong>, but also <strong>wisdom</strong> and <strong>identity</strong>. Through the brow chakra you can gain <strong>integrity</strong> and intuition and get a feeling for them, and finally go your very own way, to <strong>take the direction of your soul</strong>. Your soul can thus be guided by your intuition. The brow chakra is also called the <strong>gateway to the soul</strong> and thus to higher spiritual experiences.</p>
<p>Your third eye is also for <strong>setting goals</strong> and anticipating the <strong>long-term effects of your actions</strong>. This chakra is therefore also characterized by <strong>cultivation</strong> and <strong>projection</strong>.</p>
<p>The two physical eyes allow us to see into the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; world, but the third eye goes beyond that. It gives us *<strong>depth, vision and scope into the subtle worlds</strong>. The sense and perception itself is expanded far beyond physical reality. An <strong>opening to divine consciousness and the higher dimensions</strong> is then possible. Herein lies the origin of knowledge and the experience of being more than just your own body.</p>
<p>The brow chakra is represented by two petals, as you can see in the picture. These symbolise the <strong>duality of mind that needs to be overcome</strong>. Duality is that every thought consists of a plus and a minus. When you master the sixth chakra, the opposites of life will no longer confuse you. You will be equipped with the <strong>ability to read between the polarities or lines</strong>. Interestingly, the associated gland, the pituitary gland, also consists of two parts: anterior and posterior pituitary. Thus, an existing duality is even visible in our body.</p>
<p>The <strong>unification of opposites</strong> is also addressed here. Thus, the three main energy channels Ida, Pingala and Sushmana flow together here.</p>
<h3 id="when-your-third-eye-is-open">When your third eye is open&hellip;</h3>
<p>&hellip;then <strong>deep spiritual realms of experience</strong> will be revealed to you. You are characterized by <strong>clairvoyance, imagination</strong> and a <strong>good visualization</strong>. You can perceive ideas as inner pictures and <strong>let your own intuition lead you</strong>. Here in the third eye is the centre of your intuition, with which you get in touch. This is accompanied by a good imagination.
You will also be focused and determined and move through your life in a <strong>self-initiated</strong> way.
You will <strong>understand the meaning and content of your life</strong> with an open brow chakra, i.e. with access to your intuition and wisdom. You can <strong>attain awareness of the Divine within yourself</strong> and in everything that surrounds you and us. Deep spiritual experiences of cosmic consciousness are made possible for you. Likewise, a <strong>close communication with your soul</strong> is established and you become noticeably more sensitive to your intuition the more your Ajna is opened. For some people even <strong>telepathic communication</strong> is possible.</p>
<h3 id="ajna-in-imbalance">Ajna in imbalance</h3>
<p>With a disturbed brow chakra, states of <strong>confusion</strong> and <strong>depression</strong> are possible. The own thoughts then often revolve around <strong>fears</strong> and <strong>worries</strong>, which leads to a kind of <strong>mental forlornness</strong> and <strong>lack of orientation</strong>. As a result, feelings of <strong>senselessness</strong> arise, which have a corresponding effect on the state of mind.
In addition, <strong>lack of concentration, illusionary realities, nightmares, delusions</strong> and even <strong>hallucinations</strong> can occur. The brow chakra is then active, but in a disturbed way.
Furthermore, spirituality is often <strong>rejected</strong> by people with a blocked Ajna. This is because everything is much more viewed from the <strong>material and mind-controlled, intellectual level</strong>. Therefore, only that which is visible, measurable or has an analytical background has value. This then leads to an <strong>excess of intellectualization</strong> because the intellectual mind is overemphasized. There is the eternal attempt to have to understand everything rationally. Things and events are always questioned mentally. The reason for this can partly be the educated world view and belief system.</p>
<p><img src="Ajna.png" alt="Ajna"></p>
<h4 id="main-characteristics-of-the-third-eye">Main characteristics of the Third Eye</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sanskrit: Ajna</li>
<li>Position: Forehead, between the eyebrows</li>
<li>Color: Indigo</li>
<li>Element: Light</li>
<li>Psychological function: Self-reflection</li>
<li>Challenge: Illusions</li>
<li>Archetypal identity</li>
<li>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; / &ldquo;I have the right to see.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kundalini-yoga--ajna">Kundalini Yoga &amp; Ajna</h3>
<p>The practice of specific exercises from <strong>Kundalini Yoga</strong> can help you to open or rebalance your brow chakra.</p>
<ul>
<li>Meditations on the third eye</li>
<li>Long chanting</li>
<li>Kirtan Kriya</li>
<li>Archer Pose</li>
<li>Whistling Breathing Exercises</li>
<li>Yoga mudra</li>
<li>All exercises with the forehead on the floor</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially the <strong>chanting of &ldquo;Ong&rdquo;</strong> stimulates the cave in the cranium where the pituitary gland is located.
The vibration of the cave <strong>awakens the pituitary gland</strong> and thus triggers a more active relationship with the other higher gland, the <strong>pineal gland</strong>.</p>
<p>Again, this list of exercises is not a panacea. <strong>Please always look for yourself individually, what exactly you can do in which way.</strong> If you are uncertain, please always consult your doctor.</p>
<p>Within a Kundalini Yoga session usually different chakras are touched and activated, often with a focus. If you would like to know more about this or if you would like to book a Kundalini Yoga session with me on a specific chakra or topic, please <strong>feel free to send me an email</strong> as usual. ✉️</p>
<p>In my next blog post I will dedicate myself to the <strong>seventh chakra</strong>. To keep up to date with my current posts, I invite you to follow me on my <strong>social media channels</strong> (
